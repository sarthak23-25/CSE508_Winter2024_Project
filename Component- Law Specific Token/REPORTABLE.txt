Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. These appeals are directed against  the final
judgment and order dated 10.12.2018 passed by
the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in Crl.M.A.
1
No.49292/2018 in Crl.M.C. No.2757/2018 whereby
the High Court dismissed the application filed by
the appellant herein.
3. A few facts need mention hereinbelow for the
disposal   of   these   appeals,   which   involve   a   short
point.
4. The appellant was a consumer of electricity.
He,   therefore,   obtained   one   electricity   connection
from    respondent  No.   2   ­   BSES   Rajdhani   Power
Limited(hereinafter   referred  to   as  “BSES”)   for  his
business premises.
5. Respondent   No.   2­BSES   sent   a   bill   to   the
appellant for consumption of electricity to the tune
of   Rs.   3,54,598.21   on   22.09.2014.   According   to
BSES,   the   appellant   had   committed   theft   of
electricity   and   on   it   being   detected,   the   bill   in
question was sent to the appellant.
2
6. Since   the   appellant   failed   to   pay   the   bill
amount,   the   BSES   filed   FIR   against   him   under
Section 135 of the Electricity Act,2003 (hereinafter
referred to as “the Act”) and sought the appellant’s
prosecution   for   commission   of   theft   of   electricity
under the Act. It was also followed by notice under
Section   41   of   the   Criminal   Procedure   Code,
1973(hereinafter referred to as “the Crl.P.C.”). 
7. The appellant and BSES, however, settled the
matter in the Special Lok Adalat held on 11.02.2018
for a total sum of Rs.1,60,000/­.   An order was
accordingly   passed   by   the   Lok   Adalat   on
11.02.2018.     According   to   the   appellant,   he   has
deposited the agreed amount in two instalments.
8. The appellant, therefore, filed a petition under
Section 482 of the Crl.P.C. in the High Court of
Delhi seeking therein for quashing of the FIR filed
3
by   the   BSES   against   him   in   relation   to   the
aforementioned dispute.
9. By impugned order, the High Court dismissed
the petition, which has given rise to filing of these
appeals by way of  special leave in this Court by the
appellant(consumer).
10. Heard Mr. V.K. Sharma, learned counsel for
the appellant and Mr. K.M. Nataraj, learned ASG for
respondent   No.1   and   Mr.   Sonal   Jain,   learned
counsel for respondent No.2­BSES.
11. Learned counsel for the appellant (consumer)
referring   to   condition(iii)   of   the   order   dated
11.02.2018   of   the   Lok   Adalat   (Annexure   P­5)
contended that in the light of the settlement arrived
at between the parties wherein the BSES has agreed
to withdraw all the cases filed by them against the
appellant, the FIR and the criminal case filed by
4
BSES against him has to be disposed of in terms of
the settlement arrived at in the Lok Adalat.
12. In   reply,   learned   counsel   appearing   for
respondent No.2­BSES contended that the issue in
question   has   to   be   decided   keeping   in   view   the
requirements of Section 152 of the Act.
13.      Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties and on perusal of the record of the case, we
are inclined to allow the appeals and while setting
aside the impugned order remand the case to the
High Court for deciding the petition afresh keeping
in view the provisions of the Section 152 of the Act.
14. As  rightly pointed out  by Mr.  K.M. Nataraj,
learned   ASG   appearing   for   respondent   No.1,   the
issue in question needs to be decided in the light of
Section   152   of   the   Act,   which   deals   with
compounding of offences under the Act.
5
15. Since   we   find   that   the   High   Court   did   not
examine the issue in the light of Section 152 of the
Act, we consider it proper to remand the case to the
High Court to examine the issue afresh keeping in
view the provisions of Section 152 of the Act and
then   pass   appropriate   orders   as   the   case   may
require on the facts involved therein in accordance
with law.
16. In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeals
are allowed, the impugned order is set aside and the
case is remanded to the High Court for deciding the
matter afresh as indicated above. 
17. We   make   it   clear   that   having   formed   an
opinion to remand the case, we have not applied our
mind to the merits of the case. The High Court will,
therefore, decide the matter strictly in accordance
6
with law uninfluenced by any observations made by
us in this order.
