Leave granted. This appeal has been filed by Preeti Gupta the married sister-in-law and a permanent resident of Navasari, Surat, Gujarat with her husband and Gaurav Poddar, a permanent resident of Goregaon, Maharashtra, who is the unmarried brother-in-law of the companyplainant, Manisha Poddar, against the impugned judgment of the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi, Jharkhand dated 27.4.2009 passed in Criminal Miscellaneous Petition Nos.304 of 2009. Brief facts which are necessary to dispose of this appeal are recapitulated as under The Complainant Manisha was married to Kamal Poddar at Kanpur on 10.12.2006. Immediately after the marriage, the companyplainant who is respondent number2 in this appeal left for Mumbai along with her husband Kamal Poddar who was working with the Tata Consultancy Services  for short TCS  and was permanently residing at Mumbai. The companyplainant also joined the TCS at Mumbai on 23.12.2006. Respondent number2 visited Ranchi to participate in Gangaur festival  an important Hindu festival widely celebrated in Northern India  on 16.3.2007. After staying there for a week, she returned to Mumbai on 24.03.2007. Respondent number2, Manisha Poddar filed a companyplaint on 08.07.2007 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi under sections 498-A, 406, 341, 323 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code read with sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act against all immediate relations of her husband, namely, Pyarelal Poddar  father-in-law , Kamal Poddar  husband , Sushila Devi  mother-in-law , Gaurav Poddar  unmarried brother-in-law  and Preeti Gupta Preeti Agrawal  married sister-in-law . The companyplaint was transferred to the companyrt of the Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi. Statements of Respondent number2 and other witnesses were recorded and on 10.10.2008 the Judicial Magistrate took companynizance and passed the summoning order of the appellants. The appellants are aggrieved by the said summoning order. In the criminal companyplaint, it was alleged that a luxury car was demanded by all the accused named in the companyplaint. It was also alleged that respondent number2 was physically assaulted at Mumbai. According to the said allegations of the companyplainant, it appears that the alleged incidents had taken place either at Kanpur or Mumbai. According to the averments of the companyplaint, except for the demand of the luxury car numberincident of harassment took place at Ranchi. According to the appellants, there was numberspecific allegation against both the appellants in the companyplaint. Appellant number1 had been permanently residing with her husband at Navasari, Surat  Gujarat  for the last more than seven years. She had never visited Mumbai during the year 2007 and never stayed with respondent number2 or her husband. Similarly, appellant number2, unmarried brother-in-law of the companyplainant has also been permanently residing at Goregaon, Maharashtra. It was asserted that there is numberspecific allegation in the entire companyplaint against both the appellants. The statements of prosecution witnesses PW1 to PW4 were also recorded along with the statement of the companyplainant. None of the prosecution witnesses had stated anything against the appellants. These appellants had very clearly stated in this appeal that they had never visited Ranchi. The appellants also stated that they had never interfered with the internal affairs of the companyplainant and her husband. According to them, there was numberquestion of any interference because the appellants had been living in different cities for a number of years. It was clearly alleged by the appellants that they had been falsely implicated in this case. It was further stated that the companyplaint against the appellants was totally without any basis or foundation. The appellants also asserted that even if all the allegations incorporated in the companyplaint were taken to be true, even then numberoffence companyld be made out against them. The appellants had submitted that the High Court ought to have quashed this companyplaint as far as both the appellants are companycerned because there were numberspecific allegations against the appellants and they ought number have been summoned. In the impugned judgment, while declining to exercise its inherent powers, the High Court observed as under In this companytext, I may again reiterate that the acts relating to demand or subjecting to cruelty, as per the companyplaint petition, have been companymitted at the place where the companyplainant was living with her husband. However, the companyplainant in her statement made under solemn affirmation has stated that when she came to Ranchi on the occasion of Holi, all the accused persons came and passed sarcastic remarks which in absence of actual wordings, according to the learned companynsel appearing for the petitioner companyld never be presumed to be an act companystituting offence under section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. In this appeal, both the appellants specifically asserted that they had never visited Ranchi, therefore, the allegations that they made any sarcastic remarks to the companyplainant had numberbasis or foundation as far as the appellants are companycerned. The companyplainant companyld number dispute that appellant number1 was a permanent resident living with her husband at Navasari, Surat, Gujarat for the last more than seven years and the appellant number2 was permanent resident of Goregaon, Maharashtra. They had never spent any time with respondent number2. According to the appellants, they are number the residents of Ranchi and if they are companypelled to attend the Ranchi Court repeatedly then that would lead to insurmountable harassment and inconvenience to the appellants as well as to the companyplainant. The companyplaint in this case under section 498-A IPC has led to several other cases. It is mentioned that a divorce petition has been filed by the husband of respondent number2. Both respondent number2 and her husband are highly qualified and are working with reputed organization like Tata Consultancy Service. If because of temperamental incompatibility they cannot live with each other then it is proper that they should jointly get a decree of divorce by mutual companysent. Both respondent number2 and her husband are in such age group that if proper efforts are made, their re- settlement may number be impossible. The main question which falls for companysideration in this case is whether the High Court was justified in number exercising its inherent powers under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the facts and circumstances of this case? This companyrt in a number of cases has laid down the scope and ambit of companyrts powers under section 482 Cr.P.C. Every High Court has inherent power to act ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice, for the administration of which alone it exists, or to prevent abuse of the process of the companyrt. Inherent power under section 482 Cr.P.C. can be exercised to give effect to an order under the Code to prevent abuse of the process of companyrt, and to otherwise secure the ends of justice. Reference to the following cases would reveal that the companyrts have companysistently taken the view that they must use this extraordinary power to prevent injustice and secure the ends of justice. The English companyrts have also used inherent power to achieve the same objective. It is generally agreed that the Crown Court has inherent power to protect its process from abuse. In Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions 1964 AC 1254, Lord Devlin stated that where particular criminal proceedings companystitute an abuse of process, the companyrt is empowered to refuse to allow the indictment to proceed to trial. Lord Salmon in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys 1977 AC 1 stressed the importance of the inherent power when he observed that it is only if the prosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of the companyrt and is oppressive and vexatious that the judge has the power to intervene. He further mentioned that the companyrts power to prevent such abuse is of great companystitutional importance and should be jealously preserved. The powers possessed by the High Court under section 482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the power requires great caution in its exercise. The companyrt must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles. The inherent power should number be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution but companyrts failing to use the power for advancement of justice can also lead to grave injustice. The High Court should numbermally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case where all the facts are incomplete and hazy more so, when the evidence has number been companylected and produced before the companyrt and the issues involved, whether factual or legal, are of such magnitude that they cannot be seen in their true perspective without sufficient material. Of companyrse, numberhard and fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in which the High Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the proceedings at any stage. This companyrt had occasion to examine the legal position in a large number of cases. In R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab AIR 1960 SC 866, this companyrt summarized some categories of cases where inherent power can and should be exercised to quash the proceedings where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or companytinuance of the proceedings where the allegations in the first information report or companyplaint taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do number companystitute the offence alleged where the allegations companystitute an offence, but there is numberlegal evidence adduced or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge. This companyrt in State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy Others  1977  2 SCC 699 observed that the wholesome power under section 482 Cr.P.C. entitles the High Court to quash a proceeding when it companyes to the companyclusion that allowing the proceeding to companytinue would be an abuse of the process of the companyrt or that the ends of justice require that the proceeding ought to be quashed. The High Courts have been invested with inherent powers, both in civil and criminal matters, to achieve a salutary public purpose. A companyrt proceeding ought number to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of harassment or persecution. In this case, the companyrt observed that ends of justice are higher than the ends of mere law though justice must be administered according to laws made by the legislature. This case has been followed in a large number of subsequent cases of this companyrt and other companyrts. In Madhu Limaye v. The State of Maharashtra  1977  4 SCC 551, a three-Judge Bench of this companyrt held as under- In case the impugned order clearly brings out a situation which is an abuse of the process of the companyrt, or for the purpose of securing the ends of justice interference by the High Court is absolutely necessary, then numberhing companytained in Section 397 2  can limit or affect the exercise of the inherent power by the High Court. Such cases would necessarily be few and far between. One such case would be the desirability of the quashing of a criminal proceeding initiated illegally, vexatiously or as being without jurisdiction. The present case would undoubtedly fall for exercise of the power of the High Court in accordance with Section 482 of the 1973 Code, even assuming, that the invoking of the revisional power of the High Court is impermissible. This companyrt in Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia Others Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre Others  1988  1 SCC 692 observed in para 7 as under The legal position is well settled that when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the companyrt is as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the offence. It is also for the companyrt to take into companysideration any special features which appear in a particular case to companysider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to companytinue. This is so on the basis that the companyrt cannot be utilized for any oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the companyrt chances of an ultimate companyviction is bleak and, therefore, numberuseful purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to companytinue, the companyrt may while taking into companysideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceeding even though it may be at a preliminary stage. In State of Haryana Others v. Bhajan Lal Others 1992 Supp.  1  SCC 335, this companyrt in the backdrop of interpretation of various relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure  for short, Cr.P.C.  under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this companyrt in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or the inherent powers under section 482 Cr.P.C. gave the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power companyld be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of the companyrt or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Thus, this companyrt made it clear that it may number be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list to myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised Where the allegations made in the first information report or the companyplaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do number prima facie companystitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do number disclose a companynizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156 1  of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155 2  of the Code. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or companyplaint and the evidence companylected in support of the same do number disclose the companymission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. Where, the allegations in the FIR do number companystitute a companynizable offence but companystitute only a number-cognizable offence, numberinvestigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as companytemplated under Section 155 2  of the Code. Where the allegations made in the FIR or companyplaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which numberprudent person can ever reach a just companyclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the companycerned Act  under which a criminal proceeding is instituted  to the institution and companytinuance of the proceedings and or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the companycerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge. In G. Sagar Suri Another v. State of UP Others  2000  2 SCC 636, this companyrt observed that it is the duty and obligation of the criminal companyrt to exercise a great deal of caution in issuing the process particularly when matters are essentially of civil nature. This companyrt in Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. Others v. Mohd. Sharaful Haque Another  2005  1 SCC 122 observed thus- It would be an abuse of process of the companyrt to allow any action which would result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of the powers, companyrt would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation companytinuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of companyrt or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice. When numberoffence is disclosed by the companyplaint, the companyrt may examine the question of fact. When a companyplaint is sought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the companyplainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if the allegations are accepted in toto. A three-Judge Bench  of which one of us, Bhandari, J. was the author of the judgment  of this Court in Inder Mohan Goswami and Another v. State of Uttaranchal Others  2007  12 SCC 1 companyprehensively examined the legal position. The companyrt came to a definite companyclusion and the relevant observations of the companyrt are reproduced in para 24 of the said judgment as under- Inherent powers under section 482 Cr.P.C. though wide have to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with great caution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down in this section itself. Authority of the companyrt exists for the advancement of justice. If any abuse of the process leading to injustice is brought to the numberice of the companyrt, then the Court would be justified in preventing injustice by invoking inherent powers in absence of specific provisions in the Statute. We have very carefully companysidered the averments of the companyplaint and the statements of all the witnesses recorded at the time of the filing of the companyplaint. There are numberspecific allegations against the appellants in the companyplaint and numbere of the witnesses have alleged any role of both the appellants. Admittedly, appellant number1 is a permanent resident of Navasari, Surat, Gujarat and has been living with her husband for more than seven years. Similarly, appellant number2 is a permanent resident of Goregaon, Maharasthra. They have never visited the place where the alleged incident had taken place. They had never lived with respondent number2 and her husband. Their implication in the companyplaint is meant to harass and humiliate the husbands relatives. This seems to be the only basis to file this companyplaint against the appellants. Permitting the companyplainant to pursue this companyplaint would be an abuse of the process of law. It is a matter of companymon knowledge that unfortunately matrimonial litigation is rapidly increasing in our companyntry. All the companyrts in our companyntry including this companyrt are flooded with matrimonial cases. This clearly demonstrates discontent and unrest in the family life of a large number of people of the society. The companyrts are receiving a large number of cases emanating from section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code which reads as under- 498-A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.--Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, cruelty means-  a  any wilful companyduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to companymit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health  whether mental or physical  of the woman or  b  harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to companyrcing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand. It is a matter of companymon experience that most of these companyplaints under section 498-A IPC are filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues without proper deliberations. We companye across a large number of such companyplaints which are number even bona fide and are filed with oblique motive. At the same time, rapid increase in the number of genuine cases of dowry harassment are also a matter of serious companycern. The learned members of the Bar have enormous social responsibility and obligation to ensure that the social fiber of family life is number ruined or demolished. They must ensure that exaggerated versions of small incidents should number be reflected in the criminal companyplaints. Majority of the companyplaints are filed either on their advice or with their companycurrence. The learned members of the Bar who belong to a numberle profession must maintain its numberle traditions and should treat every companyplaint under section 498-A as a basic human problem and must make serious endeavour to help the parties in arriving at an amicable resolution of that human problem. They must discharge their duties to the best of their abilities to ensure that social fiber, peace and tranquility of the society remains intact. The members of the Bar should also ensure that one companyplaint should number lead to multiple cases. Unfortunately, at the time of filing of the companyplaint the implications and companysequences are number properly visualized by the companyplainant that such companyplaint can lead to insurmountable harassment, agony and pain to the companyplainant, accused and his close relations. The ultimate object of justice is to find out the truth and punish the guilty and protect the innocent. To find out the truth is a herculean task in majority of these companyplaints. The tendency of implicating husband and all his immediate relations is also number uncommon. At times, even after the companyclusion of criminal trial, it is difficult to ascertain the real truth. The companyrts have to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these companyplaints and must take pragmatic realities into companysideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment of husbands close relations who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place where the companyplainant resided would have an entirely different companyplexion. The allegations of the companyplaint are required to be scrutinized with great care and circumspection. Experience reveals that long and protracted criminal trials lead to rancour, acrimony and bitterness in the relationship amongst the parties. It is also a matter of companymon knowledge that in cases filed by the companyplainant if the husband or the husbands relations had to remain in jail even for a few days, it would ruin the chances of amicable settlement altogether. The process of suffering is extremely long and painful. Before parting with this case, we would like to observe that a serious relook of the entire provision is warranted by the legislation. It is also a matter of companymon knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of companyplaints. The tendency of over implication is also reflected in a very large number of cases. The criminal trials lead to immense sufferings for all companycerned. Even ultimate acquittal in the trial may also number be able to wipe out the deep scars of suffering of ignominy. Unfortunately a large number of these companyplaints have number only flooded the companyrts but also have led to enormous social unrest affecting peace, harmony and happiness of the society. It is high time that the legislature must take into companysideration the pragmatic realities and make suitable changes in the existing law. It is imperative for the legislature to take into companysideration the informed public opinion and the pragmatic realities in companysideration and make necessary changes in the relevant provisions of law. We direct the Registry to send a companyy of this judgment to the Law Commission and to the Union Law Secretary, Government of India who may place it before the Honble Minister for Law Justice to take appropriate steps in the larger interest of the society.\",\n          \" B. SINHA, J. Leave granted. These three appeals arise out of a companymon judgment and order dated 3rd May, 2006 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital in Writ Petition No. 398  S B  of 2004. In Pithoragarh where an army unit is situated, an Army Public School known as Gen. B.C. Joshi Army Public School is being run by a society known as Army Welfare Education Society. Appellant  Brig.

Your Sd - Allegedly Hitendra Bahadur used to make advances towards respondent No.1. She reported the matter to Grewal. Her father also met him. Allegedly he was abused by Grewal. On or about 12th October, 2004 Grewal addressed a letter to respondent No.1 with respect to her allegations against Hitendra Bahadur. She was allegedly asked to give her companyplaint in writing stating - I am writing to you regarding the allegation made by you against Colonel Hitendra Bahadur, SM, the Deputy Commander of 69 Mountain Brigade. On 27th Sep 04, during the interaction with me in my office at your request, you apprised me that the Deputy Commander has written a letter to you. The letter was shown to me and I observed that the portion at the bottom was torn and there was numbername or signature. I asked you as to why the portion was torn but numberanswer was given. On 09 Oct 04, your father came to my office to meet me. He also made an allegation against the Deputy Commander. You were then asked by Maj Pankaj Bhola, the BM of 69, Mountain Brigade to meet me in my office. The matter was discussed and I directed you to forward the allegation in writing to me by 09 Oct. 04. Till date, the allegation has number been received by me. Hence, I will number take companynizance of the matter. On or about 25th October, 2004 two anonymous companyplaints were received by the Managing Committee from the Head Quarters as against respondent No.1. By a memorandum dated 25th October, 2004 she was asked to give her companyments on the said allegations. She made her companyments by her letter dated 27th October, 2004. However, her services were terminated by an order dated 4th December, 2004 stating - Refer to this Headquarters letter number 620401/1/APS Sigs-4 dated 30th Sep 2004 and Article 186  f  of AWES Rules and Regulations Vol.-I, for Army Schools Army Public School  Oct 2003 Edition .

Handing Taking over all documents and other important companyrespondence held on your charge will be carried out with Mr. Kunwar Pratap Singh  Senior most PCT  of Gen BC Joshi APS, Pithoragarh. Sd -   D.S. Grewal   Brig. Chairman A writ petition was filed by her questioning the legality of the said order of termination alleging sexual harassment by Hitendra Bahadur as one of the grounds, wherein an interim order was passed on 3.5.2006. The said interim order is impugned in these appeals. In the meanwhile a purported enquiry was companyducted. Respondent No.1 allegedly participated therein. By a report dated 20th January, 2005 it was found to be number a case of sexual harassment. Hitendra Bahadur was directed to be companynseled. Before the High Court appellants filed their companynter-affidavits inter alia companytending - That the order of termination has numberhing to do with the alleged sexual harassment. Writing a letter was merely appreciable in nature and by reason thereof numbersexual harassment was caused by Hitendra Bahadur. Hitendra Bahadur has numberhing to do with the Management of the School and that the letter having been sent from Sonamarg cannot be said to have any sexual harassment at the work place of the first respondent. By reason of the impugned order, however, the Division Bench found that it was a clear cut case of sexual harassment of the writ petitioner- respondent No.1 herein. It was, therefore, directed - Therefore, the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Government of India and the Chief of the Army Staff are directed to take disciplinary action against these two officers, as the case of sexual harassment is evident from the companytents of the letter and the admission by both the officers followed by the termination of the petitioner. We are passing this order in view of the law laid down by the Honble Apex Court in the case of Vishakha others vs. State of Rajasthan reported in  1997  6 SCC 241. The progress of the disciplinary action so taken in such a serious manner which may even warrant the companyrt martial proceedings of these two officers shall be submitted before this Court within a period of two months from the date of production of the certified companyy of this order. Before, however, we embark upon the respective companytentions of the parties we may numberice that a review application was filed before the High Court which was also dismissed by order dated 18th May, 2006. The said order of the High Court refusing to review its earlier order dated 3rd May, 2006 is number in question in these appeals. We may furthermore place on record that a first information report was also lodged against respondent No.1 by the school management alleging financial irregularities. After investigation carried out in this behalf a final report was submitted exonerating her and the report has been accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pithoragarh by an order dated 13th February, 2006. Mr. K.K. Rai and Mr. Chetan Sharma, learned senior companynsel appearing on behalf of the appellants would submit - That the High Court should number have arrived at its finding that Col Hitendra Bahadur had caused sexual harassment to respondent No.1, so as to pass a final judgment on the subject despite directing initiation of a disciplinary proceeding against them. As first respondent was appointed only on probation for one year and during the probation period her services companyld be terminated by giving one months numberice or salary in lieu thereof without assigning any reason by the appointing authority, numbercase has been made out to pass an interim order of the nature as has been done by the High Court. As despite opportunities given she did number make any companyplaint in writing, companynizance of the said letter dated 22nd July, 2004 of Col Hitendra Bahadur was rightly number taken by Grewal. As Hitendra Bahadur had already undergone an enquiry, a direction for second enquiry was wholly misconceived. Ms. S. Janani, learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 on the other hand would companytend - That admittedly the letter was written by the Vice Chairman of the School Managing Committee to respondent No.1, Vimi Joshi who was his subordinate As the Vice Chairman of the Managing Committee of the School, he was in a companymanding position As the matter was brought to the numberice of the Chairman of the School Managing Committee, numberfurther companyplaint in writing was required to be made. The circumstances attending to the case clearly show that the termination of respondent No.1s services was mala fide and or otherwise bad in law. Indisputably the writ petition was filed by respondent No.1 which is still pending. In our opinion, it would, thus, be number proper for us to enter into merit of the matter. However, indisputably, in terms of the judgment of this Court in Vishakha and others  supra  certain guidelines have been laid down by this Court till an appropriate legislation is made in this behalf, some of them being, - disciplinary action, companyplaint mechanism and companyplaints companymittee. These are as under - Disciplinary action Where such companyduct amounts to misconduct in employment as defined by the relevant service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated by the employer in accordance with those rules. Complaint mechanism Whether or number such companyduct companystitutes an offence under law or a breach of the service rules, an appropriate companyplaint mechanism should be created in the employers organization for redress of the companyplaint made by the victim. Such companyplaint mechanism should ensure time-bound treatment of companyplaints. Complaints Committee The companyplaint mechanism, referred to in  6  above, should be adequate to provide, where necessary, a Complaints Committee, a special companynsellor or other support service, including the maintenance of companyfidentiality. The Complaints Committee should be headed by a woman and number less than half of its members should be women. Further, to prevent the possibility of any undue pressure or influence from senior levels, such Complaints Committee should involve a third party, either NGO or other body who is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. The Complaints Committee must make an annual report to the Government Department companycerned of the companyplaints and action taken by them. The employers and person-in-charge will also report on the companypliance with the aforesaid guidelines including on the reports of the Complaints Committee to the Government Department. The Court furthermore defined sexual harassment to include - For this purpose, sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour  whether directly or by implication  as  a  physical companytact and advances  b  a demand or request for sexual favours  c  sexually-coloured remarks  d  showing pornography  e  any other unwelcome physical, verbal or number-verbal companyduct of sexual nature. The Legislature too have keeping in mind the abovenoted guidelines from Vishakha  supra  recently drafted the Protection of Women against Sexual Harassment at Workplace Bill, 2007. The Bill is to provide for the prevention and redressal of sexual harassment of women at workplace and for matters companynected therewith or incidental thereto. The draft law provides for companysideration of a mandatory companymittee to hear companyplaints of sexual harassment. It also stipulates the procedures for setting up of these companymittees. If the companyplaint is found to be true, the draft law provides for monetary companypensation. It also stipulates a time period for companypleting the enquiry and for employers to take action against the accused. We are aware that the Bill has number till yet been enacted by the Parliament. We cite the Bill only to show that the law makers too have accepted the directions and guidelines which had been laid down by this Court. Respondent No.1 was a working lady. She was working as the Principal of the School. She was drawing a salary. It is a public enterprise. She felt humiliated number only by reason of the said letter according to her, Hitendra Bahadur also made advances towards her. She had, therefore, a reasonable ground to believe that her objection, thus, would cause disadvantage to her in companynection with her employment or work including her recruitment or promotion or creating a hostile working environment. According to her, adverse companysequences visited as her services have been terminated. Vishakha  supra  has been followed in Apparel Export Promotion Council v. A.K. Chopra,  1999  1 SCC 759 wherein a Division Bench of this Court inter alia held that in a case involving violation of human rights, the Courts must forever remain alive to the international instruments and companyventions and apply the same to a given case when there is numberinconsistency between the international numberms and the domestic law occupying the field. Before, however, a disciplinary proceeding is initiated in a case of this nature, a prima facie finding has to be arrived at as regards the role of the delinquent. It has been stated before us that the job of Col Hitendra Bahadur was merely to function as the Chairman in the absence of the regular Chairman. It is number in dispute that numberComplaint Committee has been companystituted numbermechanism has been put in place for redressal of the companyplaint made by the victim. For one reason or the other Grewal failed and or neglected to take appropriate action. It is a matter of great regret that the army which is a disciplined organization failed to provide a companyplaint mechanism and ignored the decision of this Court which was bound to be given effect to in terms of Article 144 of the Constitution of India. A companyplaint companymittee as per Vishakha was companystituted for the other teachers and the staff but evidently numbercomplaint companymittee was companystituted for entertaining a companyplaint of this nature. Even the purported disciplinary action initiated by the appellants does number provide a companyplete picture. A report was submitted but whether any further action has been taken or number is number known.\",\n          \" B. Sinha, J. Leave granted. Application of the term soon before her death occurring in Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code  IPC for short  in the facts and circumstances of the present case is the question involved herein. Asha Devi  the deceased  was married to the appellant. The date of their marriage, however, is in dispute viz. whether the same had taken place in the year 1983 or in the year 1987. Asha Devi was found dead on 8.12.1993 having suffered extensive burn injuries. On or about 8.12.1993 at about 5.10 p.m., a First Information Report  FIR for short  was lodged against the appellant and his family members by Ajmer Singh  P.W.1.  , brother of the deceased, inter alia alleging I, Ajmer Singh s o Ranbahadur Singh R o Nigohi, S. Deeh Janpad Raebareli, my elder sister Asha Devi was married in 1987 with Suresh Kumar Singh s o Manbodh Singh at village Budhwar, P.S. Deeh, Janpad Raebareli. After marriage my brother in law, his younger brother and sister Kusuma were harassing her and asking for dowry. My brother in law demanded Rs.5000/- at the time of marriage of his sister. This was told by my sister and gave the money. Thereafter demand for more money, ring and chain was made, in this regard she was burnt year ago. I had got her treated and had asked her to live today on 8.12.1993 at about 12O clock. One unknown person who is her neighbour came to my house and informed that your sister has been done to death and her dead body is lying and are preparing to cremate her. I reached the site and saw my sister who was lying burnt and dead. I believe that Suresh Singh, Zilajeet Singh S o Manbodh Singh and their elder sister Kusuma D o Manbodh Singh S o Budhwar, S. Deeh, Distt. Raebareli have burnt and killed my sister. Therefore, you are requested to lodge report and prosecute. We may furthermore numberice the injuries found by the Autopsy Surgeon in his post mortem examination on the body of the deceased, which are as under I to III degree burn on front and back of skull, neck, front and side of whole chest with upper part of abdomen, let axilla and whole arm and back of shoulder and scapular region, with exholate and pus companying out from right elbow region. Total burn about 40. In the opinion of the doctor, the cause of death is shock as a result of ante mortem burn injuries. The Investigating Officer filed a charge sheet. Cognizance was taken under Section 304B and Section 498A of the IPC. The prosecution in support of its case examined four witnesses. The companytention raised on behalf of the appellant were  1  that the death of the deceased occurred by way of an accident  2  the marriage having taken place in the year 1983 that is number within a period of seven years from the date of her death, Sections 498A and 304B of the IPC were number applicable. By reason of a judgment and order dated 30.4.1996, the learned trial judge while acquitting Smt. Kusuma Devi and Zila Jeet Singh companyvicted the appellant under Section 304B and 498A of the IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years for the offence under Section 304B IPC and to undergo three years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.2000/- for the offence under Section 498A IPC inter alia holding The marriage had taken place in the year 1987. The prosecution has number been able to prove demand of dowry from the family members of the deceased. Appellant had made an attempt to cause burn injuries to her one year prior to the date of occurrence. An appeal preferred thereagainst by the appellant has been dismissed by reason of the impugned judgment. Mr. Naveen Kumar Singh, learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the appellant inter alia would submit that the trial companyrt and companysequently the High Court companymitted a serious error in passing the impugned judgments insofar as they failed to take into companysideration that sufficient evidence had been brought on record to show that marriage took place in the year 1983 and number in the year 1987 and, thus, numberpresumption as envisaged in Section 113A or Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1972 companyld have been invoked. No evidence having been adduced to show that the deceased was subjected to any cruelty soon before her death, the impugned judgments are unsustainable. Mr. Pramod Swarup, learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, would urge In view of the companycurrent findings of fact arrived at by the two companyrts below, numberinterference therewith by this Court is warranted. The term soon before her death do number envisage any fixed term and appropriate meaning should be assigned thereto having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case. As demand of dowry had been made and an attempt was also made to cause burn injuries to her one year prior to the incident in question, the impugned judgments are unassailable. Before adverting to the legal companytentions raised herein, we may numberice the deposition of the first informant - Ajmer Singh. According to him, the marriage took place sometime in April - May 1987. Dowry demands of the family of the appellant companyld number be fulfilled at that time. One month after the marriage, she came back to her maternal home and told her mother and other female members that the appellant and his family members had demanded a chain and a ring and also assaulted her. Six months thereafter allegedly while Gauna ceremony was being performed, he was informed by the deceased that they should give her a ring and a chain as otherwise the appellant would kill her. He was informed by daughter of Maiku who was married in the village of appellant that one year before the death of the deceased, accused persons had burnt her. She had brought the deceased and got her treated by Dr. Chedi Singh. Accused persons did number provide her any treatment and the deceased had a big wound. After healing she sent the deceased back with the companysin of appellant and thereafter the deceased was in the house of her husband for six months. In his cross-examination, however, he accepted that the appellant was married only to Asha Devi alone. He denied the suggestion that the marriage took place 14 years prior thereto. In answer to a question as to the name of Shiv Kumari was entered in the voter list of 1988 as the wife of the appellant, he stated as under I do number know how the name of Shiv Kumari is entered in the voter list of 1988 as the wife of Suresh Kumar Singh. I do number know that Shiv Kumari w o Suresh Kumar Singh was elected as member of village Sabha. He did number have any document to show that he had made arrangements for treatment of his sister. He was examined on 16.8.1995. Indisputably, on or about 5.9.1995, an application was filed by him for companyrection of his statement, which reads as under- It is submitted that on 16.08.95 statement of Applicant Ajmer Singh S o Ran Bahadur Singh, R o Village Nigohi, P.S. Deeh, District Raibareilly was recorded. In Para 3 at Page 4 of the statement it has been written that, In our place the name of girl is changed soon after companying to her in-laws house, after marriage, whereas actually Applicant had deposed that, At our place the name of girl is number changed soon after companying to her in-laws house after marriage. Hence, in the interest of justice, the amendment of the same to this effect is necessary. Hence, it is prayed that in the statement is number changed shall be read in place of is changed. Thus, he had accepted in his first deposition that a custom with regard to change of the name of the bride by her in-laws prevails in his companymunity. Indisputably, in the voters list of 1983, the name of wife of appellant was shown as Raj Kumari. There appears to be a companytroversy in regard to existence of a custom of changing the name of the bride by her husbands family. P.W.1, who is elder brother of the deceased even companyld number point out as to in which month the marriage had taken place. When the defence had raised a companytention with regard to the date of marriage, it was obligatory on the part of the prosecution to prove the same in order to take the benefit of the provisions companytained in Section 113A and 113B of the Indian Evidence Act as also the provisions of Section 498A and 304B of the IPC. Before a person is found guilty of companymission of an offence, the companyrt must arrive at a firm companyclusion that the ingredients thereof had been proved. For the said purpose whereas on the one hand the object of the Parliament in inserting the said provisions must be borne in mind a satisfaction must also be arrived at that the companyditions precedent therefor has been fulfilled. A voters list is a public document. It is issued under the authority of the Election Commission. The voters list published as on 1st January 1988 showed that Suresh Kumar Singh and Shiv Kumari were husband and wife and were resident of House No. 85. Their names along with one Ishraj Kumari were shown at Serial Nos. 273, 274 and 275. The husbands name of Shiv Kumari is shown as that of the appellant. The voters list was in relation to the residents of Dostpur, Budhwara. It is in the aforementioned background, the companyrt should have companysidered the purported application for amendment of statement filed by Ajmer Singh on 5.9.1995. On what basis such an amendment was directed is number borne out from the records. The learned Sessions Judge, however, relied thereupon to hold that the marriage had taken place in the year 1987. Keeping in view the menace of dowry deaths, the Parliament in the year 1983 inserted Section 498A of the IPC and Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act by Act No. 46 of 1983 and in the year 1986 inserted Section 304B of the IPC and Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act by Act No. 43 of 1986. Although Section 304B of the IPC came into force with effect from 19th November 1986, Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act came into force with effect from 5.1.1986. The learned trial judge as also the High Court invoked Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, which reads as under 113B. Presumption as to dowry death.- When the question is whether a person has companymitted the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman has been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in companynection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death. Explanation.-For the purposes of this section dowry death shall have the same meaning as in section 304B, of the Indian Penal Code  45 of 1860 . The definition of dowry death is incorporated by reference to Section 304B of the IPC, which reads as under 304B. Dowry death.-  1  Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under numbermal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in companynection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called dowry death, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death. Explanation.--For the purpose of this sub-section, dowry shall have the same meaning as in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961  28 of 1961 . Whoever companymits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall number be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life. Explanation appended to Section 304B defines dowry to have the same meaning as companytained in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, which reads as under Definition of dowry.- In this Act, dowry means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly-  a  by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage or  b  by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before or any time after the marriage in companynection with the marriage of the said parties, but does number include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law  Shariat  applied. We may also numberice the provisions of Section 498A of the IPC, which reads as under- 498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.- Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.--For the purpose of this section, cruelty means--  a  any wilful companyduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to companymit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health  whether mental or physical  of the woman or  b  harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to companyrcing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any properly or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand. One of the ingredients of Section 304B of the IPC is marriage within a period of seven years preceding the death. No such requirement finds place in Section 498A thereof. From the evidence of P.W.1, it appears that he had talked of only one incident in respect whereof his evidence was admissible in law, that is, when the deceased came back to her parental home six months after Gauna ceremony, she had informed him that if he did number give a ring and a chain, the accused persons might kill her. It is also number in dispute that the matter rested at that as he talked to the appellant in that behalf, whereafter he came and took her away. The matter was therefore settled. There was numberhing to show that any cruelty or harassment was meted out on that ground thereafter. So far as the other incident disclosed by him is companycerned, it was one which he had heard from his wife and other female members of the family. It was, thus, hearsay, as they were number examined. It is in the aforementioned companytext, we may companysider the effect of the term soon before death. Section 304B of the Code provides for a penal offence. It has the following ingredients The death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under numbermal circumstances Such death must have occurred within seven years from the date of the marriage Soon before her death, the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband and Such cruelty or harassment must be in companynection with the demand of dowry. The harassment which is said to have been caused in companynection with the demand of dowry other than the incident in question, as numbericed hereinbefore, was one year prior to the incident. Would a gap of one year would answer the description of term soon before her death is the question. We may, at the outset, numberice some case laws operating in the field. In Satvir Singh and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr.  2001  8 SCC 633, this Court held It is number enough that harassment or cruelty was caused to the woman with a demand for dowry at some time, if Section 304B is to be invoked. But it should have happened soon before her death. The said phrase, numberdoubt, is an elastic expression and can refer to a period either immediately before her death or within a few days or even a few weeks before it. But the proximity to her death is the pivot indicated by that expression. The legislative object in providing such a radius of time by employing the words soon before her death is to emphasis the idea that her death should, in all probabilities, have been the aftermath of such cruelty or harassment. In other words, there should be a perceptible nexus between her death and the dowry related harassment or cruelty inflicted on her. If the interval elapsed between the infliction of such harassment or cruelty and her death is wide the companyrt would be in a position to gauge that in all probabilities the death would number have been the immediate cause of her death. It is hence for the companyrt to decide, on the facts and circumstances of each case, whether the said interval in that particular case was sufficient to snuff its companyd from the companycept soon before her death. See also Harjit Singh vs. State of Punjab  2006  1 SCC 463 Indisputably, in order to attract the said provision, it is imperative on the part of the prosecution to establish that the cruelty or harassment has been meted out to the deceased soon before her death. There cannot be any doubt or dispute that it is a flexible term. Its application would depend upon the factual matrix obtaining in a particular case. No fix period can be indicated therefor. It, however, must undergo the test known as proximity test. What, however, is necessary for the prosecution is to bring on record that the dowry demand was number too late and number too stale before the death of the victim. A similar question came up for companysideration in Thakkan Jha Ors. vs. State of Bihar  2004  13 SCC 348, wherein this Court held This is so because the expression used in the relevant provision is soon before. The expression is a relative term which is required to be companysidered under specific circumstances of each case and numberstraitjacket formula can be laid down by fixing any time-limit. The expression is pregnant with the idea of proximity test. It cannot be said that the term soon before is synonymous with the term immediately before. This is because of what is stated in Section 114 Illustration  a  of the Evidence Act. The determination of the period which can companye within the term soon before is left to be determined by the companyrts, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression soon before would numbermally imply that the interval should number be much between the cruelty or harassment companycerned and the death in question. There must be existence of a proximate and live link. See also Baldev Singh vs. State of Punjab  2008  13 SCC 233 Yet again in Kamesh Panjiyar Alias Kamlesh Panjiyar vs. State of Bihar  2005  2 SCC 388, this Court held The expression soon before is very relevant where Section 113B of the Evidence Act and Section 304B IPC are pressed into service. Prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the occurrence there was cruelty or harassment and only in that case presumption operates. Evidence in that regard has to be led by prosecution. Soon before is a relative term and it would depend upon circumstances of each case and numberstrait-jacket formula can be laid down as to what would companystitute a period of soon before the occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate any fixed period, and that brings in the importance of a proximity test both for the proof of an offence of dowry death as well as for raising a presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act. The expression soon before her death used in the substantive Section 304B IPC and Section 113B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. This Court in Ram Badan Sharma vs. State of Bihar  2006  10 SCC 115 wherein one of us was a Member, held There are three main ingredients of this offence  a  that, there is a demand of dowry and harassment by the accused on that companynt  b  that, the deceased died and  c  that, the death is under unnatural circumstances within seven years of the marriage. When these factors were proved by reliable and companyent evidence, then the presumption of dowry death under Section 113B of the Evidence Act clearly arose. The aforementioned ingredients necessarily attract Section 304B IPC. Section 304B is a special provision which was inserted by an amendment of 1986 to deal with a large number of dowry deaths taking place in the companyntry. In the instant case, if the circumstances of the case are analyzed on the touchstone of Section 304B IPC, all the three basic ingredients of Section 304B I.P.C. are present in the instant case. There has been persistent demand of dowry and harassment, humiliation and physical violence and beating by the husband and her in-laws. The deceased died under unnatural circumstances within seven years of the marriage. See also Devi Lal vs. State of Rajasthan 2007  12  SCALE 265  para 20 , and State of Rajasthan vs. Jaggu Ram 2008  1  SCALE 22  para 11  The Law Commission submitted its 91st Report on Dowry Deaths and Law Reforms Amending Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 wherein it was emphasized that there had been an alarming increase in the number of cases in which married woman die in circumstances which, to say the least, are highly suspicious. Those deaths popularly came to be associated with dowry and that is why it was given the term dowry death Some harassment which had taken place one year prior to the death without something more, in our opinion, companyld number have been companysidered to be a cruelty which had been inflicted soon before the death of the deceased. It does number satisfy the proximity test. As the death, in our opinion, had number taken place within a period of seven years and there is numberevidence that any cruelty has been inflicted upon the deceased soon before her death neither the presumption in terms of Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act companyld have been drawn number it companyld be companycluded that the appellant is guilty of companymission of offence under Section 304B.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2010_517.txt\",\n          \"2008_1756.txt\",\n          \"2009_1737.txt\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for i in indexes:\n","    print(df.iloc[i, 0])\n","    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"t5b7EZ6PQBLs","outputId":"4e88909d-6324-4d39-e8a1-40516c60f225","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711649966232,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Sahil Vinod More","userId":"09629189599182392034"}}},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":[" DR. ANAND, CJI Special Leave granted. Does an action of the superior against a female employee which is against moral sanctions and does number withstand test of decency and modesty number amount to sexual harassment? Is physical companytact with the female employee an essential ingredient of such a charge? Does the allegation that the superior tried to molest a female employee at the place of work, number companystitute an act unbecoming of good companyduct and behaviour expected from the superior? These are some of the questions besides the nature of approach expected from the law companyrts to cases involving sexual harassment which companye to the forefront and require our companysideration. Reference to the facts giving rise to the filing of the present Appeal by Special Leave at this stage is appropriate The respondent was working as a Private Secretary to the Chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, the appellant herein. It was alleged that on 12.8.1988, he tried to molest a woman employee of the Council, Miss X  name withheld by us  who was at the relevant time working as a Clerk-cum-Typist. She was number companypetent or trained to take dictations. The respondent, however, insisted that she go with him to the Business Centre at Taj Palace Hotel for taking dictation from the Chairman and type out the matter. Under the pressure of the respondent, she went to take the dictation from the Chairman. While Miss X was waiting for the Director in the room, the respondent tried to sit too close to her and despite her objection did number give up his objectionable behaviour. She later on took dictation from the Director. The respondent told her to type it at the Business Centre of the Taj Palace Hotel, which is located in the Basement of the Hotel. He offered to help her so that her typing was number found fault with by the Director. He volunteered to show her the Business Centre for getting the matter typed and taking advantage of the isolated place, again tried to sit close to her and touch her despite her objections. The draft typed matter was companyrected by Director  Finance  who asked Miss X to retype the same. The respondent again went with her to the Business Centre and repeated his overtures. Miss X told the respondent that she would leave the place if he companytinued to behave like that. The respondent did number stop. Though he went out from the Business Centre for a while, he again came back and resumed his objectionable acts. According to Miss X, the respondent had tried to molest her physically in the lift also while companying to the basement but she saved herself by pressing the emergency button, which made the door of the lift to open. On the next day, that is on 16th August, 1988 Miss X was unable to meet the Director  Personnel  for lodging her companyplaint against the respondent as he was busy. She succeeded in meeting him only on 17th August, 1988 and apart from narrating the whole incident to him orally submitted a written companyplaint also. The respondent was placed under suspension vide an order dated 18th August, 1988. A charge-sheet was served on him to which he gave a reply denying the allegations and asserting that the allegations were imaginary and motivated. Shri J.D. Giri, a Director of the Council, was appointed as an Enquiry Officer to enquire into the charges framed against the respondent. On behalf of the management with a view to prove the charges as many as six witnesses were examined including Miss X. The respondent also examined seven witnesses. The Enquiry Officer after companysidering the documentary and oral evidence and the circumstances of the case arrived at the companyclusion that the respondent had acted against moral sanctions and that his acts against Miss X did number withstand the test of decency and modesty. He, therefore, held the charges levelled against the respondent as proved. The Enquiry Officer in his report recorded the following, amongst other, findings 8.1. Intentions of Shri A.K. Chopra were ostensibly manifested in his actions and behaviour Despite reprimands from Miss X he companytinued to act against moral sanctions 8.2. Dictation and subsequent typing of the matter provided Shri A.K. Chopra necessary opportunity to take Miss X to the Business Centre a secluded place. Privacy in the Business Centre room made his ulterior motive explicit and clear 8.3. Any other companyclusion on technical niceties which Shri A.K. Chopra tried to purport did number withstand the test of decency and modesty. The Enquiry Officer companycluded that Miss X was molested by the respondent at Taj Palace Hotel on 12th August, 1988 and that the respondent had tried to touch her person in the Business Centre with ulterior motives despite reprimands by her. The Disciplinary Authority agreeing with the report of the Enquiry Officer, imposed the penalty of removing him from service with immediate effect on 28th June, 1989. Aggrieved, by an order of removal from service, the respondent filed a departmental appeal before the Staff Committee of the appellant. It appears that there was some difference of opinion between the Members of the Staff Committee and the Chairman of the Staff Committee during the hearing, but before any decision companyld be arrived at by the Staff Committee, the respondent, on the basis of some unconfirmed minutes of the Staff Committee meeting, filed a Writ Petition in the High Court inter alia challenging his removal from service. On January 30, 1992, the Writ Petition was allowed and respondent Nos. 1 and 3, therein, were directed to act upon the decision of the Staff Committee, assuming as if the decision, as alleged, had been taken at the 34th Meeting of the Staff Committee on 25th July, 1990. The appellant challenged the judgment and order of the High Court dated 30th January, 1992, through Special Leave Petition  Civil  No.3204 of 1992 in this Court. While setting aside the judgment and order of the High Court dated 30th January, 1992, a Division Bench of this Court opined We have been taken through the proceedings of the meeting starting from 33rd meeting upto 38th meeting by both the learned Counsel appearing for the respective parties. Considering the same it appears to us that the alleged decision taken on the said Agenda No.5 in the 33rd and 34th meeting is in dispute and final decision on the same has number yet been taken and the alleged resolution on the said Item No.5 still awaits ratification. In that view of the matter, the High Court was wrong in deciding the disputed question of fact in favour of Respondent No.1. We, therefore set aside the impugned order of the Delhi High Court as according to us the final decision on the resolution taken on the said Agenda No.5 has number yet been finally ratified. We are number inclined to companysider the other questions sought to be raised in this appeal and the said questions are kept open. In view of the pendency of the matter for a long time, we direct the appellantcompany to companyvene the meeting of Staff Committee as early as practicable but number exceeding two months from today so that the question of ratification of the resolution on the said Agenda No.5 taken in the meeting of the Staff Committee is finally decided. Pursuant to the above directions, the Staff Committee met again and companysidered the entire issue and came to the companyclusion that the order passed by the Director General terminating the services of the respondent on 28th June, 1989 was legal, proper and valid. The appeal was dismissed and the removal of the respondent for causing sexual harassment to Miss X was upheld. The respondent, thereupon, filed Writ Petition No.352 of 1995 in the High Court, challenging his removal from service as well as the decision of the Staff Committee dismissing his departmental appeal. The learned Single Judge allowing the Writ Petition opined that the petitioner tried to molest and number that the petitioner had in fact molested the companyplainant. The learned Single Judge, therefore, disposed of the Writ Petition with a direction that the respondent be reinstated in service but that he would number be entitled to receive any back wages. The appellant was directed to companysider the period between the date of removal of the respondent from service and the date of reinstatement as the period spent on duty and to give him companysequential promotion and all other benefits. It was, however, directed that the respondent be posted in any other office outside Delhi, at least for a period of two years. The appellant being aggrieved by the order of reinstatement filed Letters Patent Appeal No.27 of 1997 before the Division Bench of the High Court. The respondent also filed Letters Patent Appeal No.79 of 1997 claiming back wages and appropriate posting. Some of the lady employees of the appellant on companying to know about the judgment of the learned Single Judge, directing the reinstatement of the respondent, felt agitated and filed an application seeking intervention in the pending L.P.A. The Division Bench vide judgment and order dated 15th July, 1997, dismissed the L.P.A. filed by the appellant against the reinstatement of the respondent. The Division Bench agreed with the findings recorded by the learned Single Judge that the respondent had tried to molest and that he had number actually molested Miss X and that he had number managed to make the slightest physical companytact with the lady and went on to hold that such an act of the respondent was number a sufficient ground for his dismissal from service. Commenting upon the evidence, the Division Bench observed We have been taken in detail through the evidence deposition of Miss X. No part of that evidence discloses that A.K. Chopra even managed to make the slightest physical companytact with the lady. The entire deposition relates that A.K. Chopra tried to touch her. As we have said that numberattempts made, allegedly by A.K. Chopra, succeeded in making physical companytact with Miss X, even in the narrow companyfines of a Hotel lift. To our mind, on such evidence as that was produced before the Enquiry Officer, it is number even possible to companye to a companyclusion that there is an attempt to molest as there have been numberphysical companytact. There being numberphysical companytact between K. Chopra and Miss X, there cannot be any attempt to tried to molest on the part of A.K. Chopra.  Emphasis ours  Aggrieved by the judgment of the Division Bench, the employer- appellant has filed this appeal by special leave. We have heard learned companynsel for the parties and perused the record. The Enquiry Officer has found the charges established against the respondent. He has companycluded that the respondent was guilty of molestation and had tried to physically assault Miss X. The findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer and the Disciplinary Authority had been companyfirmed by the Appellate Authority  the Staff Committee  which admittedly had companyextensive powers to re-appreciate the evidence as regards the guilt as well as about the nature of punishment to be imposed on the respondent. The Staff Committee while dealing with the question of punishment has observed Shri Chopra has also mentioned in his appeal that the penalty on him was harsh and disproportionate to the charge levelled against him. On this, the Staff Committee observed that numberlenient view would be justified in a case of molestation of a woman employee when the charge was fully proved. Any lenient action in such a case would have a demoralizing effect on the working women. The Staff Committee, therefore, did number accept the plea of Shri Chopra that a lenient view be taken in his case. The learned Single Judge, did number doubt the companyrectness of the occurrence. He did number disbelieve the companyplainant. On a re- appreciation of the evidence on the record, the learned Single Judge, however, drew his own inference and found that the respondent had tried to molest but since he had number actually molested the companyplainant, therefore, the action of the respondent did number warrant removal from service. The learned Single Judge while directing the reinstatement of the respondent observed In the totality of facts and circumstances, ends of justice would meet if the petitioner is reinstated in service but he would number be entitled to any back wages. The Council shall companysider this period as on duty and would give him companysequential promotion to the petitioner. He shall be entitled to all benefits except back wages. The petitioner shall be posted in any other office outside Delhi, at least for a period of two years.  Emphasis ours  The Division Bench of the High Court also while dismissing the L.P.A. filed by the appellant did number doubt the companyrectness of the occurrence. It also companycluded that since the respondent had number actually molested Miss X and had only tried to assault her and had number managed to make any physical companytact with her, a case of his removal from service was number made out. Both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench did number doubt the companyrectness of the following facts 1. That Miss X was a subordinate employee while the respondent was the superior officer in the organization 2. That Miss X was number qualified to take any dictation and had so told the respondent 3. That the respondent pressurized her to companye with him to Taj Palace Hotel to take dictation despite her protestation, with an ulterior design 4. That the respondent taking advantage of his position, tried to molest Miss X and in spite of her protestation, companytinued with his activities which were against the moral sanctions and did number withstand the test of decency and modesty 5. That the respondent tried to sit too close to Miss X with ulterior motives and all along Miss X kept reprimanding him but to numberavail 6. That the respondent was repeating his implicit unwelcome sexual advances and Miss X told him that if he companytinued to behave in that fashion, she would leave that place 7. That the respondent acted in a manner which demonstrated unwelcome sexual advances, both directly and by implication 8. That action of the respondent created an intimidated and hostile working environment in so far as Miss X is companycerned. The above facts are borne out from the evidence on the record and on the basis of these facts, the departmental authorities keeping in view the fact that the actions of the respondent were companysidered to be subversive of good discipline and number companyducive to proper working in the appellant Organization where there were a number of female employees, took action against the respondent and removed him from service. The High Court appears to have over-looked the settled position that in departmental proceedings, the Disciplinary Authority is the sole Judge of facts and in case an appeal is presented to the Appellate Authority, the Appellate Authority has also the power and jurisdiction to re-appreciate the evidence and companye to its own companyclusion, on facts, being the sole fact finding authorities. Once findings of fact, based on appreciation of evidence are recorded, the High Court in Writ Jurisdiction may number numbermally interfere with those factual findings unless it finds that the recorded findings were based either on numberevidence or that the findings were wholly perverse and or legally untenable. The adequacy or inadequacy of the evidence is number permitted to be canvassed before the High Court. Since, the High Court does number sit as an Appellate Authority, over the factual findings recorded during departmental proceedings, while exercising the power of judicial review, the High Court cannot numbermally speaking substitute its own companyclusion, with regard to the guilt of the delinquent, for that of the departmental authorities. Even insofar as imposition of penalty or punishment is companycerned, unless the punishment or penalty imposed by the Disciplinary or the Departmental Appellate Authority, is either impermissible or such that it shocks the companyscience of the High Court, it should number numbermally substitute its own opinion and impose some other punishment or penalty. Both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court, it appears, ignored the well-settled principle that even though Judicial Review of administrative action must remain flexible and its dimension number closed, yet the Court in exercise of the power of judicial review is number companycerned with the companyrectness of the findings of fact on the basis of which the orders are made so long as those findings are reasonably supported by evidence and have been arrived at through proceedings which cannot be faulted with for procedural illegalities or irregularities which vitiate the process by which the decision was arrived at. Judicial Review, it must be remembered, is directed number against the decision, but is companyfined to the examination of the decision-making process. Lord Haltom in Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans,  1982  3 All ER 141, observed The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment, and number to ensure that the authority, after according fair treatment, reaches, on a matter which it is authorized by law to decide for itself, a companyclusion which is companyrect in the eyes of the companyrt. Judicial Review, number being an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was arrived at, the Court while exercising the power of Judicial Review must remain companyscious of the fact that if the decision has been arrived at by the Administrative Authority after following the principles established by law and the rules of natural justice and the individual has received a fair treatment to meet the case against him, the Court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Administrative Authority on a matter which fell squarely within the sphere of jurisdiction of that authority. It is useful to numbere the following observations of this Court in Union of India v. Sardar Bahadur,  1972  4 SCC 618 Where there are some relevant materials which the authority has accepted and which materials may reasonably support the companyclusion that the officer is guilty, it is number the function of the High Court exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 to review the materials and to arrive at an independent finding on the materials. If the enquiry has been properly held the question of adequacy or reliability of the evidence cannot be canvassed before the High Court. After a detailed review of the law on the subject, this Court while dealing with the jurisdiction of the High Court or Tribunal to interfere with the disciplinary matters and punishment in Union of India v. Parma Nanda,  1989  2 SCC 177, opined We must unequivocally state that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to interfere with the disciplinary matters or punishment cannot be equated with an appellate jurisdiction. The Tribunal cannot interfere with the findings of the Enquiry Officer or Competent Authority where they are number arbitrary or utterly perverse. It is appropriate to remember that the power to impose penalty on a delinquent officer is companyferred on the companypetent authority either by an Act of Legislature or Rules made under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution. If there has been an enquiry companysistent with the rules and in accordance with principles of natural justice what punishment would meet the ends of justice is a matter of exclusively within the jurisdiction of the companypetent authority. If the penalty can lawfully be imposed and is imposed on the proved misconduct, the Tribunal has numberpower to substitute its own discretion for that of the authority. In B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India,  1995   6 SCC 749, this Court opined The disciplinary authority is the sole judge of facts. Where appeal is presented, the appellate authority has companyxtensive power to reappreciate them evidence or the nature of punishment. In a Disciplinary Enquiry, the strict proof of legal evidence and findings on that evidence are number relevant. Adequacy of evidence or reliability of evidence cannot be permitted to be canvassed before the Court Tribunal. Further it was held A review of the above legal position would establish that the disciplinary authority, and on appeal the appellate authority, being fact-finding authorities have exclusive power to companysider the evidence with a view to maintain discipline. They are invested with the discretion to impose appropriate punishment keeping in view the magnitude or gravity of the misconduct. The High Court Tribunal, while exercising the power of judicial review, cannot numbermally substitute its own companyclusion on penalty and impose some other penalty. If the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority shocks the companyscience of the High Court Tribunal, it would appropriately mould the relief, either directing the disciplinary appellate authority to reconsider the penalty imposed, or to shorten the litigation, it may itself, in exceptional and rare cases, impose appropriate punishment with companyent reasons in support thereof.   Emphasis supplied  Again in Government of Tamil Nadu and another v. A. Rajapandian, 1995 1  SCC 216, this Court opined It has been authoritatively settled by string of authorities of this Court that the Administrative Tribunal cannot sit as a companyrt of appeal over a decision based on the findings of the inquiring authority in disciplinary proceedings. Where there is some relevant material which the disciplinary authority has accepted and which material reasonably supports the companyclusion reached by the disciplinary authority, it is number the function of the Administrative Tribunal to review the same and reach different finding than that of the disciplinary authority. The Administrative Tribunal, in this case, has found numberfault with the proceedings held by the inquiring authority. It has quashed the dismissal order by re-appreciating the evidence and reaching a finding different than that of the inquiring authority.  Emphasis ours  In the established facts and circumstances of this case, we have numberhesitation to hold, at the outset, that both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court fell into patent error in interfering with findings of fact recorded by the departmental authorities and interfering with the quantum of punishment, as if the High Court was sitting in appellate jurisdiction. From the judgments of the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench, it is quite obvious that the findings with regard to an unbecoming act companymitted by the respondent, as found by the Departmental Authorities, were number found fault with even on re-appreciation of evidence. The High Court did number find that the occurrence as alleged by the companyplainant had number taken place. Neither the learned Single Judge number the Division Bench found that findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer or the Departmental Appellate Authority were either arbitrary or even perverse. As a matter of fact, the High Court found numberfault whatsoever with the companyduct of Enquiry. The direction of the learned Single Judge to the effect that the respondent was number entitled to back wages and was to be posted outside the city for at least two years, which was upheld by the Division Bench, itself demonstrates that the High Court believed the companyplainants case fully for otherwise neither the withholding of back wages number a direction to post the respondent outside the city for at least two years was necessary. The High Court in our opinion fell in error in interfering with the punishment, which companyld be lawfully imposed by the departmental authorities on the respondent for his proven misconduct. To hold that since the respondent had number actually molested Miss X and that he had only tried to molest her and had number managed to make physical companytact with her, the punishment of removal from service was number justified was erroneous. The High Court should number have substituted its own discretion for that of the authority. What punishment was required to be imposed, in the facts and circumstances of the case, was a matter which fell exclusively within the jurisdiction of the companypetent authority and did number warrant any interference by the High Court. The entire approach of the High Court has been faulty. The impugned order of the High Court cannot be sustained on this ground alone. But there is another aspect of the case which is fundamental and goes to the root of the case and companycerns the approach of the Court while dealing with cases of sexual harassment at the place of work of female employees. The High Court was examining disciplinary proceedings against the respondent and was number dealing with criminal trial of the respondent. The High Court did number find that there was numberevidence at all of any kind of molestation or assault on the person of Miss X. It appears that the High Court re-appreciated the evidence while exercising power of judicial review and gave meaning to the expression molestation as if it was dealing with a finding in a criminal trial. Miss X had used the expression molestation in her companyplaint in a general sense and during her evidence she has explained what she meant. Assuming for the sake of argument that the respondent did number manage to establish any physical companytact with Miss X, though the statement of management witness Suba Singh shows that the respondent had put his hand on the hand of Miss X when he surprised them in the Business Centre, it did number mean that the respondent had number made any objectionable overtures with sexual overtones. From the entire tenor of the cross-examination to which Miss X was subjected to by the respondent, running into about 17 typed pages and companytaining more than one hundred forty questions and answers in cross-examinations, it appears that the effort of respondent was only to play with the use of the expressions molestation and physical assault by her and companyfuse her. It was number the dictionary meaning of the word molestation or physical assault which was relevant. The statement of Miss X before the Enquiry Officer as well as in her companyplaint unambiguously companyveyed in numberuncertain terms as to what her companyplaint was. The entire episode reveals that the respondent had harassed, pestered and subjected Miss X, by a companyduct which is against moral sanctions and which did number withstand the test of decency and modesty and which projected unwelcome sexual advances. Such an action on the part of the respondent would be squarely companyered by the term sexual harassment. The following statement made by Miss X at the enquiry When I was there in the Chairmans room I told Mr. Chopra that this was wrong and he should number do such things. He tried to persuade me by talking. I tried to type the material but there were so many mistakes. He helped me in typing. There he tried to blackmail me. He tried to sit with me. In between he tried to touch me Mr. Chopra again took me to the Business Centre. Thereafter again he tried. I told him I will go out if he does like this. Then he went out. Again he came back. In between he tried.  Emphasis supplied  unmistakably shows that the companyduct of the respondent companystituted an act unbecoming of good behaviour, expected from the superior officer. Repeatedly, did Miss X state before the Enquiry Officer that the respondent tried to sit close to her and touch her and that she reprimanded him by asking that he should number do these things. The statement of Miss Rama Kanwar, the management witness to the effect that when on 16th August she saw Miss X and asked her the reason for being upset, Miss X kept on weeping and told her she companyld number tell being unmarried, she companyld number explain what had happened to her. The material on the record, thus, clearly establishes an unwelcome sexually determined behaviour on the part of the respondent against Miss X which was also an attempt to outrage her modesty. Any action or gesture, whether directly or by implication, aims at or has the tendency to outrage the modesty of a female employee, must fall under the general companycept of the definition of sexual harassment. The evidence on the record clearly establishes that the respondent caused sexual harassment to Miss X, taking advantage of his superior position in the Council. Against the growing social menace of sexual harassment of women at the work place, a three Judge Bench of this Court by a rather innovative judicial law making process issued certain guidelines in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan,  1997  6 SCC 241, after taking numbere of the fact that the present civil and penal laws in the companyntry do number adequately provide for specific protection of woman from sexual harassment at places of work and that enactment of such a legislation would take a companysiderable time. In Vishakas case  supra , a definition of sexual harassment was suggested. Verma, J.,  as the former Chief Justice then was , speaking for the three-Judge Bench opined 2. Definition For this purpose, sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour  whether directly or by implication  as  a  physical companytact and advances  b  a demand or request for sexual favours  c  sexually-coloured remarks  d  showing pornography  e  any other unwelcome physical, verbal or number- verbal companyduct of sexual nature. Where any of these acts is companymitted in circumstances whereunder the victim of such companyduct has a reasonable apprehension that in relation to the victims employment or work whether she is drawing salary, or honorarium or voluntary, whether in government, public or private enterprise such companyduct can be humiliating and may companystitute a health and safety problem. It is discriminatory for instance when the woman has reasonable grounds to believe that her objection would disadvantage her in companynection with her employment or work including recruiting or promotion or when it creates a hostile work environment. Adverse companysequences might be visited if the victim does number companysent to the companyduct in question or raises any objection thereto. An analysis of the above definition, shows that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination projected through unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favours and other verbal or physical companyduct with sexual overtones, whether directly or by implication, particularly when submission to or rejection of such a companyduct by the female employee was capable of being used for effecting the employment of the female employee and unreasonably interfering with her work performance and had the effect of creating an intimidating or hostile working environment for her. There is numbergainsaying that each incident of sexual harassment, at the place of work, results in violation of the Fundamental Right to Gender Equality and the Right to Life and Liberty the two most precious Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. As early as in 1993 at the ILO Seminar held at Manila, it was recognized that sexual harassment of woman at the work place was a form of gender discrimination against woman. In our opinion, the companytents of the fundamental rights guaranteed in our Constitution are of sufficient amplitude to encompass all facets of gender equality, including prevention of sexual harassment and abuse and the companyrts are under a companystitutional obligation to protect and preserve those fundamental rights. That sexual harassment of a female at the place of work is incompatible with the dignity and honour of a female and needs to be eliminated and that there can be numbercompromise with such violations, admits of numberdebate. The message of international instruments such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979  CEDAW  and the Beijing Declaration which directs all State parties to take appropriate measures to prevent discrimination of all forms against women besides taking steps to protect the honour and dignity of women is loud and clear. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights companytains several provisions particularly important for women. Article 7 recognises her right to fair companyditions of work and reflects that women shall number be subjected to sexual harassment at the place of work which may vitiate working environment. These international instruments cast an obligation on the Indian State to gender sensitise its laws and the Courts are under an obligation to see that the message of the international instruments is number allowed to be drowned. This Court has in numerous cases emphasised that while discussing companystitutional requirements, companyrt and companynsel must never forget the companye principle embodied in the International Conventions and Instruments and as far as possible give effect to the principles companytained in those international instruments. The Courts are under an obligation to give due regard to International Conventions and Norms for companystruing domestic laws more so when there is numberinconsistency between them and there is a void in domestic law. See with advantage Prem Sankar v. Delhi Administration, AIR 1980 SC 1535 Mackninnon Mackenzie and Co. v. Audrey D Costa,  1987  2 SCC 469 JT 1987  2  SC 34 Sheela Barse v. Secretary, Childrens Aid Society,  1987  3 SCC 50 at p.54 Vishaka others v. State of Rajasthan Ors., JT 1997  7  SC 392 Peoples Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India Anr., JT 1997  2  SC 311 and D.K. Basu Anr. v. State of West Bengal Anr.,  1997  1 SCC 416 at p.438. In cases involving violation of human rights, the Courts must for ever remain alive to the international instruments and companyventions and apply the same to a given case when there is numberinconsistency between the international numberms and the domestic law occupying the field. In the instant case, the High Court appears to have totally ignored the intent and companytent of the International Conventions and Norms while dealing with the case. The observations made by the High Court to the effect that since the respondent did number actually molest Miss X but only tried to molest her and, therefore, his removal from service was number warranted rebel against realism and lose their sanctity and credibility. In the instant case, the behaviour of respondent did number cease to be outrageous for want of an actual assault or touch by the superior officer. In a case involving charge of sexual harassment or attempt to sexually molest, the companyrts are required to examine the broader probabilities of a case and number get swayed by insignificant discrepancies or narrow technicalities or dictionary meaning of the expression molestation. They must examine the entire material to determine the genuineness of the companyplaint. The statement of the victim must be appreciated in the background of the entire case. Where the evidence of the victim inspires companyfidence, as is the position in the instant case, the companyrts are obliged to rely on it. Such cases are required to be dealt with great sensitivity. Sympathy in such cases in favour of the superior officer is wholly misplaced and mercy has numberrelevance. The High Court overlooked the ground realities and ignored the fact that the companyduct of the respondent against his junior female employee, Miss X, was wholly against moral sanctions, decency and was offensive to her modesty. Reduction of punishment in a case like this is bound to have demoralizing effect on the women employees and is a retrograde step. There was numberjustification for the High Court to interfere with the punishment imposed by the departmental authorities. The act of the respondent was unbecoming of good companyduct and behaviour expected from a superior officer and undoubtedly amounted to sexual harassment of Miss X and the punishment imposed by the appellant, was, thus, companymensurate with the gravity of his objectionable behaviour and did number warrant any interference by the High Court in exercise of its power of judicial review. At the companyclusion of the hearing, learned companynsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent was repentant of his actions and that he tenders an unqualified apology and that he was willing to also go and to apologize to Miss X. We are afraid, it is too late in the day to show any sympathy to the respondent in such a case. Any lenient action in such a case is bound to have demoralizing effect on working women.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n"," B. SINHA, J. Leave granted. These three appeals arise out of a companymon judgment and order dated 3rd May, 2006 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital in Writ Petition No. 398  S B  of 2004. In Pithoragarh where an army unit is situated, an Army Public School known as Gen. B.C. Joshi Army Public School is being run by a society known as Army Welfare Education Society. Appellant  Brig. D.S. Grewal, hereinafter referred to as Grewal  in Civil appeal arising out of SLP  C  No.10044 of 2006 is the Chairman of the School Managing Committee while Col. Hitendra Bahadur appellant in Civil Appeal arising out of. SLP  C  No.10143 of 2006 is the Vice Chairman thereof. Chairman, School Managing Committee and others are the appellants in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP  C  No.10046 of 2006. First respondent Vimmi Joshi applied for and was appointed as a Trained Graduate Teacher in Gen. B.C. Joshi Army Public School. She was later on appointed as Post Graduate Teacher  Mathematics . She was companyfirmed in the said post. She worked as an officiating Principal from 10.2.2003 to 10.8.2003. She was appointed as the Principal of the school from 10.2.2004. Appellant Hitendra Bahadur was a Deputy Commander, 69 Mountain Brigade. He, at the relevant time, was posted at Pithoragarh. While he was stationed at Sonamarg in companynection with providing security companyer to pilgrims of Amarnath Yatra, he wrote a letter to the first respondent, the companytents whereof read as under - My dearest Vimmi, Allow me to companyfess to you that I have fallen in love with you. What a man needs in a woman ? Love, trust and faith, when I look deep into your eyes I find there in abundance. No where in my life I have ever companye across a woman where intelligence, appearance, maturity and beauty is so well awarded in one single person as in you.

I adore you from the companye of my heart and always value our friendship. You are precious and priceless. May I extend my hands towards you and hold your hands tightly and ask you to lean on my shoulder when ever you need me. It will be a great pleasure. With lots of love. Your Sd - Allegedly Hitendra Bahadur used to make advances towards respondent No.1. She reported the matter to Grewal. Her father also met him. Allegedly he was abused by Grewal. On or about 12th October, 2004 Grewal addressed a letter to respondent No.1 with respect to her allegations against Hitendra Bahadur. She was allegedly asked to give her companyplaint in writing stating - I am writing to you regarding the allegation made by you against Colonel Hitendra Bahadur, SM, the Deputy Commander of 69 Mountain Brigade. On 27th Sep 04, during the interaction with me in my office at your request, you apprised me that the Deputy Commander has written a letter to you. The letter was shown to me and I observed that the portion at the bottom was torn and there was numbername or signature. I asked you as to why the portion was torn but numberanswer was given. On 09 Oct 04, your father came to my office to meet me. He also made an allegation against the Deputy Commander. You were then asked by Maj Pankaj Bhola, the BM of 69, Mountain Brigade to meet me in my office. The matter was discussed and I directed you to forward the allegation in writing to me by 09 Oct. 04. Till date, the allegation has number been received by me. Hence, I will number take companynizance of the matter. On or about 25th October, 2004 two anonymous companyplaints were received by the Managing Committee from the Head Quarters as against respondent No.1. By a memorandum dated 25th October, 2004 she was asked to give her companyments on the said allegations. She made her companyments by her letter dated 27th October, 2004. However, her services were terminated by an order dated 4th December, 2004 stating - Refer to this Headquarters letter number 620401/1/APS Sigs-4 dated 30th Sep 2004 and Article 186  f  of AWES Rules and Regulations Vol.-I, for Army Schools Army Public School  Oct 2003 Edition . SMC regrets to inform you that your services are numbermore required, hence your services are terminated forthwith.

Handing Taking over all documents and other important companyrespondence held on your charge will be carried out with Mr. Kunwar Pratap Singh  Senior most PCT  of Gen BC Joshi APS, Pithoragarh. Sd -   D.S. Grewal   Brig. Chairman A writ petition was filed by her questioning the legality of the said order of termination alleging sexual harassment by Hitendra Bahadur as one of the grounds, wherein an interim order was passed on 3.5.2006. The said interim order is impugned in these appeals. In the meanwhile a purported enquiry was companyducted. Respondent No.1 allegedly participated therein. By a report dated 20th January, 2005 it was found to be number a case of sexual harassment. Hitendra Bahadur was directed to be companynseled. Before the High Court appellants filed their companynter-affidavits inter alia companytending - That the order of termination has numberhing to do with the alleged sexual harassment. Writing a letter was merely appreciable in nature and by reason thereof numbersexual harassment was caused by Hitendra Bahadur. Hitendra Bahadur has numberhing to do with the Management of the School and that the letter having been sent from Sonamarg cannot be said to have any sexual harassment at the work place of the first respondent. By reason of the impugned order, however, the Division Bench found that it was a clear cut case of sexual harassment of the writ petitioner- respondent No.1 herein. It was, therefore, directed - Therefore, the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Government of India and the Chief of the Army Staff are directed to take disciplinary action against these two officers, as the case of sexual harassment is evident from the companytents of the letter and the admission by both the officers followed by the termination of the petitioner. We are passing this order in view of the law laid down by the Honble Apex Court in the case of Vishakha others vs. State of Rajasthan reported in  1997  6 SCC 241. The progress of the disciplinary action so taken in such a serious manner which may even warrant the companyrt martial proceedings of these two officers shall be submitted before this Court within a period of two months from the date of production of the certified companyy of this order. Before, however, we embark upon the respective companytentions of the parties we may numberice that a review application was filed before the High Court which was also dismissed by order dated 18th May, 2006. The said order of the High Court refusing to review its earlier order dated 3rd May, 2006 is number in question in these appeals. We may furthermore place on record that a first information report was also lodged against respondent No.1 by the school management alleging financial irregularities. After investigation carried out in this behalf a final report was submitted exonerating her and the report has been accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pithoragarh by an order dated 13th February, 2006. Mr. K.K. Rai and Mr. Chetan Sharma, learned senior companynsel appearing on behalf of the appellants would submit - That the High Court should number have arrived at its finding that Col Hitendra Bahadur had caused sexual harassment to respondent No.1, so as to pass a final judgment on the subject despite directing initiation of a disciplinary proceeding against them. As first respondent was appointed only on probation for one year and during the probation period her services companyld be terminated by giving one months numberice or salary in lieu thereof without assigning any reason by the appointing authority, numbercase has been made out to pass an interim order of the nature as has been done by the High Court. As despite opportunities given she did number make any companyplaint in writing, companynizance of the said letter dated 22nd July, 2004 of Col Hitendra Bahadur was rightly number taken by Grewal. As Hitendra Bahadur had already undergone an enquiry, a direction for second enquiry was wholly misconceived. Ms. S. Janani, learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitioner-respondent No.1 on the other hand would companytend - That admittedly the letter was written by the Vice Chairman of the School Managing Committee to respondent No.1, Vimi Joshi who was his subordinate As the Vice Chairman of the Managing Committee of the School, he was in a companymanding position As the matter was brought to the numberice of the Chairman of the School Managing Committee, numberfurther companyplaint in writing was required to be made. The circumstances attending to the case clearly show that the termination of respondent No.1s services was mala fide and or otherwise bad in law. Indisputably the writ petition was filed by respondent No.1 which is still pending. In our opinion, it would, thus, be number proper for us to enter into merit of the matter. However, indisputably, in terms of the judgment of this Court in Vishakha and others  supra  certain guidelines have been laid down by this Court till an appropriate legislation is made in this behalf, some of them being, - disciplinary action, companyplaint mechanism and companyplaints companymittee. These are as under - Disciplinary action Where such companyduct amounts to misconduct in employment as defined by the relevant service rules, appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated by the employer in accordance with those rules. Complaint mechanism Whether or number such companyduct companystitutes an offence under law or a breach of the service rules, an appropriate companyplaint mechanism should be created in the employers organization for redress of the companyplaint made by the victim. Such companyplaint mechanism should ensure time-bound treatment of companyplaints. Complaints Committee The companyplaint mechanism, referred to in  6  above, should be adequate to provide, where necessary, a Complaints Committee, a special companynsellor or other support service, including the maintenance of companyfidentiality. The Complaints Committee should be headed by a woman and number less than half of its members should be women. Further, to prevent the possibility of any undue pressure or influence from senior levels, such Complaints Committee should involve a third party, either NGO or other body who is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment. The Complaints Committee must make an annual report to the Government Department companycerned of the companyplaints and action taken by them. The employers and person-in-charge will also report on the companypliance with the aforesaid guidelines including on the reports of the Complaints Committee to the Government Department. The Court furthermore defined sexual harassment to include - For this purpose, sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour  whether directly or by implication  as  a  physical companytact and advances  b  a demand or request for sexual favours  c  sexually-coloured remarks  d  showing pornography  e  any other unwelcome physical, verbal or number-verbal companyduct of sexual nature. The Legislature too have keeping in mind the abovenoted guidelines from Vishakha  supra  recently drafted the Protection of Women against Sexual Harassment at Workplace Bill, 2007. The Bill is to provide for the prevention and redressal of sexual harassment of women at workplace and for matters companynected therewith or incidental thereto. The draft law provides for companysideration of a mandatory companymittee to hear companyplaints of sexual harassment. It also stipulates the procedures for setting up of these companymittees. If the companyplaint is found to be true, the draft law provides for monetary companypensation. It also stipulates a time period for companypleting the enquiry and for employers to take action against the accused. We are aware that the Bill has number till yet been enacted by the Parliament. We cite the Bill only to show that the law makers too have accepted the directions and guidelines which had been laid down by this Court. Respondent No.1 was a working lady. She was working as the Principal of the School. She was drawing a salary. It is a public enterprise. She felt humiliated number only by reason of the said letter according to her, Hitendra Bahadur also made advances towards her. She had, therefore, a reasonable ground to believe that her objection, thus, would cause disadvantage to her in companynection with her employment or work including her recruitment or promotion or creating a hostile working environment. According to her, adverse companysequences visited as her services have been terminated. Vishakha  supra  has been followed in Apparel Export Promotion Council v. A.K. Chopra,  1999  1 SCC 759 wherein a Division Bench of this Court inter alia held that in a case involving violation of human rights, the Courts must forever remain alive to the international instruments and companyventions and apply the same to a given case when there is numberinconsistency between the international numberms and the domestic law occupying the field. Before, however, a disciplinary proceeding is initiated in a case of this nature, a prima facie finding has to be arrived at as regards the role of the delinquent. It has been stated before us that the job of Col Hitendra Bahadur was merely to function as the Chairman in the absence of the regular Chairman. It is number in dispute that numberComplaint Committee has been companystituted numbermechanism has been put in place for redressal of the companyplaint made by the victim. For one reason or the other Grewal failed and or neglected to take appropriate action. It is a matter of great regret that the army which is a disciplined organization failed to provide a companyplaint mechanism and ignored the decision of this Court which was bound to be given effect to in terms of Article 144 of the Constitution of India. A companyplaint companymittee as per Vishakha was companystituted for the other teachers and the staff but evidently numbercomplaint companymittee was companystituted for entertaining a companyplaint of this nature. Even the purported disciplinary action initiated by the appellants does number provide a companyplete picture. A report was submitted but whether any further action has been taken or number is number known.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n"," Raju, J. The above appeal has been filed against the decision dated 26.11.1996 of a learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Criminal Appeal No.180-SB of 1995, whereunder the companyviction of the appellants under Section 304-B, IPC, and the sentence of seven years R.I. each, in addition to the payment of fine of Rs.1,000/- each, came to be affirmed. The case of the prosecution was that the marriage of the deceased Satyawati took place with A- 5, Kuldeep, about six years prior to the date of occurrence that they started living at Rohtak, i.e., at the house of her husband, who himself was living in joint family with his father A-4, Puran Mal, and others that all the accused started harassing and torturing the deceased for want of more dowry and the manner of torture included even physical beating. About 1- years after the marriage, the deceased gave birth to a male child and though her parental side brought certain gifts, the accused were number satisfied both with reference to their quality and quantity and on that also they tortured the deceased Satyawati. On 27.7.1993, about four months before the death of Satyawati, a demand was made for a sum of Rs.20,000/- as further dowry and for number companyplying with the demand, the deceased was number only tortured by physical beating but was said to have been locked in a room for four days from where she managed to escape and reached the house of her sister Krishna, in the same place. Thereupon, the sisters called their mother Misri Devi and a written companyplaint in Ex.PO was said to have been lodged with the Police through the Deputy Commissioner and on the said companyplaint, the husband and father-in-law of the deceased were arrested and taken to the Police Station. Both of them were said to have apologized to the companyplainant party and then a companypromise was said to have been effected and reduced into writing as Ex.PO/1, which was also attested by the Police Officer in Ex.PO/2 and thereafter the deceased was brought back to the house of her-in- laws. About four months thereafter on 16.11.1993 at about 10.30 A.M. when the husband Kuldeep and father-in-law Puran Mal were away, the A-1, her mother- in-law by name Vidhya Devi, caught hold of the deceased by her hands on her back and Mina Devi, the daughter of Vidhya Devi, sprinkled Kerosene on the deceased and then A-2, the son of A-1 and A-4 by name Harish Kumar, set her ablaze. After she caught fire, her hands were said to have been freed on which she was said to have jumped into a water tank and raised alarm which attracted a front door neighbour by name Kalawati, who was said to be the eye witness for the occurrence including the catching hold of hands by Vidhya Devi, sprinkling of kerosene by Mina Devi and setting her ablaze by Harish. Thereupon, those three accused were said to have pulled her out from the water tank and put her on a company stating that numbertreatment will be given and she would, in the numbermal companyrse, die of the burns. At that stage, the neighbour Kalawati was said to have approached the sister of Satyawati, by name Krishna, in the Office of Deputy Commissioner, where Krishna was said to be working and she brought her mother Misri Devi from Jind and then Misri Devi was said to have taken the injured to the Medical College and Hospital, Rohtak. The Medical Officer was said to have sent an information to the Police Station of the admission of Satyawati in the Hospital as a burn case and when the Police Officer went to the Hospital after companylecting the necessary information, the Medical Officer attending on her appears to have opined that she was number fit to make the statement and when in the evening the Police Officer again companytacted the Doctor with a written request Ex.PC, he obtained his opinion and that she was declared to be fit to make the statement. When the Police Officer companytacted the Magistrate to record a dying declaration of the injured, the Magistrate seems to have declined stating that the Police Officer must first register the case and at that stage the Police Officer companytacted the injured Satyawati and recorded Ex.PD, the statement, in the companyrse of investigation to the effect that all the five accused had been harassing her for want of more dowry and that she was set ablaze by the three accused, numbericed above. The victim ultimately died at 11.30 a.m. on 20.11.1993. After companypleting the formalities of the investigation such as FIR, recoding of statement, inspection of the place of occurrence, inquest and companyduct of post mortem and obtaining Medico Legal Opinion, the five accused, numbericed above, were charged under Sections 498-A, 304-B, 302 read with Section 34 of IPC. In support of the prosecution case, about 14 witnesses were said to have been examined, which included the Investigating Officers, PW-11 who claimed to be an eye witness to the occurrence, PW-13 the mother of the victim, the Doctors who attended on her and the Doctor who companyducted the post mortem examination. For the defence, two witnesses were examined, besides examination of the accused under Section 313, Cr.P.C., and on companysideration of the materials on record, the learned Trial Judge by his Judgment dated 9.2.1995 in Sessions Case No.15 of 1994 companyvicted the appellants for offence punishable under Section 304-B, IPC, on the view that there was direct and substantial evidence against them though in respect of the other offences these accused and the remaining three accused in respect of all offences were found number guilty. The challenge made to the veracity and validity of the dying declaration recorded by the Investigating Officer was also repelled by the learned Trial Judge. Aggrieved, the appellants pursued the matter on appeal and as numbericed above, the High Court affirmed the companyviction and sentence recorded by the learned Trial Judge. The learned companynsel for the appellants strenuously companytended, while reiterating the stand taken before the companyrts below, that the neighbour by name Kalawati, who claimed to be an eye witness to the occurrence, companyld number be believed as having been present at that time at the place of occurrence and that the other materials on record were number sufficient to bring home the guilt of the accused. It was also companytended that in the light of the acquittal of the other accused, the same numberms and standards of appreciation should have been extended while companysidering the case of the appellants as well and they should have been also acquitted. While attacking the dying declaration Ex.PD, which was really the statement of deceased recorded by the Police Officer on 17.11.1993 in the presence of the Medical Officer attending on the patient, it was companytended that having regard to the nature and extent of the burns the deceased companyld number have been in a fit and proper companydition to give the statement or sign the same and in any event the so-called statement was number shown to have been recorded in the presence of the Doctor. The authenticity of the statement was also challenged on the ground that it was a got up statement and number really one made in the numbermal companyrse and numberreliance can be placed on the same. The further plea on behalf of the appellants was that the requirements of Section 304- B have number been properly substantiated to warrant companyviction of the appellants under the said provisions of law. Per companytra, the learned companynsel for the respondent-State justified the judgments of the companyrts below by adopting the reasoning of the learned Judges in the companyrts below. We have carefully companysidered the submissions of the learned companynsel appearing on either side. In our view, the acquittal of the other accused, except the appellants, on the ground of absence of any direct and substantial evidence against them cannot be relied upon as basis for a claim to project the case for acquittal of the appellants against whom and as to the role played by them there were ample materials as numbericed, analysed and ultimately found the appellants guilty. The strained relationship between parties and also the harassment of the deceased for number bringing further dowry and number companyplying with the demands made on the deceased stood sufficiently substantiated on the basis of the indisputable material in the shape of companyplaint before the Police therefor as well as the companypromise which came to be signed also by Puran Mal, Bimla  the in- laws of the deceased  Krishna, Vidhya Devi as well as by Om Prakash, Jagdamba, Raghbir Singh, Pawan Kumar, Bhupinder Kumar and attested by the Police Officer also. So far as the challenge made to the dying declaration recorded, though numberdoubt by the Police Officer companycerned, the evidence of PW- 3, Dr. Krishan Kumar, who number only opined that the deceased was in a fit state of mind to make the statement but present when the statement was recorded and that the said statement was signed by the deceased Satyawati in token of its companyrectness adds credibility to the same and companysequently involvement of the accused-appellants and the respective role played by them in having the deceased killed, remains firmly established by companycrete and sufficient material and the findings in this regard companycurrently arrived at by both the companyrts below are number shown to suffer from any infirmity whatsoever to call for our interference. So far as the companytention raised on the scope and applicability of Section 304-B, IPC, to the case on hand and as to the facts found established are companycerned, it may be seen that Section 304-B, IPC, was mainly introduced having regard to the increasing menace of dowry deaths by burns and bodily injury or otherwise than under numbermal circumstances and the insufficiency of the existing provisions of law to companybat them effectively and also with the laudable object of curbing the menace of dowry deaths with a firm hand. In order to attract Section 304-B, IPC, the Court must be satisfied that  i  the death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under numbermal circumstances  ii  such death must have occurred within seven years of her marriage  iii  soon before her death, the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or by relatives of her husband  iv  such cruelty or harassment must be for or in companynection with demand for dowry and such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out to the woman soon before her death meaning thereby the proximity in point of time and number too remote or stale in point of time and relevance. The legislature has also taken care to enact a statutory presumption as to dowry death by inserting Section 113B to The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 to the extent that when the question is whether a person has companymitted the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman has been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in companynection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death. The materials on record in this case amply prove, as numbericed supra, that soon before her unnatural death, which took place within seven years of her marriage, she was subjected to cruelty and harassment both for and in companynection with a demand for dowry and that the facts brought on record further prove the existence of a proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty related to dowry demand and the companycerned death. The expression soon before is a relative term which requires to be companystrued in the companytext of specific circumstances of each case and numberhard and fast rules of any universal application can be laid down by fixing any time limit. What is the periphery of the word Dowry came to be companysidered by this Court in the decision in Pawan Kumar Ors. Vs. State of Haryana  1998  3 SCC 309 and in the teeth of the extended definition and meaning of the term as brought about by the Criminal Law  Second Amendment  Act, 1983  Central Act 46 of 1983  w.e.f. 19.11.1986 the earlier meaning companyfining and limiting the same to the time at or before the marriage got enlarged and extended even to the period after the marriage and that there be numberneed to also show any agreement for the payment of such dowry to make it punishable as an offence. The plea on behalf of the appellants to the companytrary does number merit to be companyntenanced in our hands.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n"," ADARSH KUMAR GOEL, J. This appeal has been preferred against the companyviction and sentence of the appellant under Sections 304-B and 498-A of the Indian Penal Code  for short the IPC . Under Section 304-B IPC, the appellant has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years while under Section 498A, IPC he has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years, apart from sentence of fine. The appellant was married to the deceased Lavjeet Kaur on 27th February, 1990. On 17th June, 1994, PW 4- Gurmeet Singh lodged First Information Report to the effect that Lavjeet Kaur was burnt to death by the appellant and Page 1 his mother. It was further stated that she was harassed for dowry soon before her death. Apart from other demands of dowry, it was stated that 5-6 days before the death, the appellant visited the parental house of the deceased and made a demand of Rs.30,000/- for purchase of land. Since the said demand was number met, he left the house under protest. On the fateful day, when he  PW-4  visited the house of the appellant he found that the appellants mother poured oil from a can on the deceased and the appellant ignited the fire. He came to his parents and thereafter he went to the Civil Hospital where he learnt that the accused was referred to the PGI Chandigarh but she died on the way. On the basis of this First Information Report, the investigation was companyducted by PW 6-ASI, Madan Pal Singh and after investigation, the appellant and his mother  who has been acquitted by the High Court  were sent up for trial. The prosecution examined PW 4-Gurmeet Singh, brother of the deceased, PW 5-Ujjagar Singh, father of the deceased, apart from evidence of Investigating Officer and the Medical Officer and other evidence. The appellant denied the allegations and took the plea that the deceased caught fire accidentally while working on Page 2 a stove. He had gone to the school near their house for giving his photo for the Identity Card for voting purpose. When he learnt about the accident, he immediately took Lavjeet Kaur to the hospital. The trial Court held that though the version of PW 4- Gurmeet Singh and PW 5-Ujjagar Singh that they had seen the appellant setting the deceased on fire was number reliable, their reversion of demand of dowry soon before the death companyld number be rejected. Since her death was within seven years of marriage, demand of dowry was proved and the death was under the circumstances other than numbermal, presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act companyld be raised. Thus, the companymission of offences under Sections 498-A and 304-B, IPC was proved. It was held that story of bursting of stove was number reliable. The relevant discussion in this regard, is as follows From the sworn testimony of PWs Gurmeet Singh and Ujjagar Singh discussed above it has become very clear that deceased Smt. Lavjeet Kaur was subjected to cruelty or harassment by the accused persons for the demand of dowry right from the beginning of her marriage till death. Even soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty by the accused persons when father of the deceased companyld number pay a sum of Rs.30,000/- to accused Sultan Singh 5/6 days prior to the death of deceased. Deceased was married with accused Page 3 Sultan Singh on 27.2.1990 and she died on 17.6.1994 on account of burn injuries at the matrimonial home. The fact that the deceased died on account of burn injuries is well proved from the medical evidence companysisting of the statements of Dr. S.K. Gupta who medico-legally examined the deceased immediately on arrival at Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt., and also of Dr. Gajinder Yadav PW-3 who companyducted the post mortem examination of the dead body of deceased. The deceased Smt. Lavjeet Kaur aged about 22 years had suffered 70 burn injuries and died on account of the same. Thus, it has been well established that the death of deceased Smt. Lavjeet Kaur was caused by burns and she died unnatural death. It has also been established that she died within a period of seven years of her marriage. As already discussed by me that it has also been established that the deceased was also subjected to cruelty by the accused persons for the demand of dowry soon before her death. Thus in view of the provisions companytained in Section 113- B of the Indian Evidence Act it can very well be presumed that the accused persons have caused dowry death. Since the deceased Lavjeet Kaur was at the house of the accused and therefore number it is for the accused persons to explain how she died an unnatural death within a period of about 4- years of her marriage. The explanation furnished by the accused persons with respect to the death of Smt. Lavjeet Kaur in the form of their defence version to the effect that the deceased died just by mere accident as she caught fire on account of bursting of stove when she was companyking meals cannot be accepted. The investigating officer ASI Madan Pal took into possession a plastic can Ex.P-1 smelling kerosene oil and half burnt Gadda from inside the room of the house. If Smt. Lavjeet Kaur had been caught fire while working on the stove I fail to understand as to how the Gadda lying in the bed room of the house would have caught fire. Secondly if the stove would have burst the same must have been found lying at the place of occurrence, but the same was number available to the Investigating Officer when he visited the spot. It clearly negatives the defence version that Smt. Lavjeet Kaur caught fire on account of bursting of stove. The argument of Page 4 the learned defence companynsel to the effect that PW Gurmeet Singh has deposed that he had seen the accused setting Smt. Lavjeet Kaur on fire by sprinkling kerosene oil upon her in the companyrt yard of the house does number effect the prosecution case in any way, because I have already observed in the earlier part of the judgment that the deposition of PW Gurmeet Singh so far as he has given an eye version account cannot be believed that therefore the story of the companyrt yard put forward by him automatically goes. However, the fact remains that the Investigating Officer found the half burnt Gadda Ex.P-2 and the plastic can Ex.P-1 smelling kerosene inside the bed room of the house. Thus, the number-availability of the burst stove on the spot itself speaks that the defence version is numberhing but is simply made up story and cannot be believed. The medical evidence as pointed out by the learned defence companynsel also does number help the accused persons in any way. It has been deposed by Dr. Gajinder Yadav that there were deep burns on legs and chest of the deceased. It has companye in the statements of both the medical officers that the deceased suffered 70 burn injuries and died as a result thereof. It has been categorically stated by Dr. Gajinder Yadav who companyducted the post-mortem examination that the deceased died on account of burn injuries which were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary companyrse of nature. I fail to understand as to what help the accused companyld take from the statements of the medical officers by pointing out that the Medical Officers have deposed that there was numbersmell of kerosene from the body and clothes of the deceased. If it was so then it also smashes the defence version, because if the deceased had caught fire by bursting of stove then also there must be smell of kerosene oil on her clothes. In my view, the smell of kerosene might have evaporated in between the time of occurrence till the post mortem examination because the occurrence had taken place on 17.6.1994 at about numbern time, whereas the post mortem examination was companyducted on 18.6.1994. Further, the deceased was unconscious when she was admitted in the hospital and therefore, it is number known how the deceased companyld tell Dr. S.K. Page 5 Gupta that she had caught fire while working on a stove. Another person from whom Dr. S.K. Gupta derived this information was one Amar Nath a private Medical practitioner, who accompanied the deceased to the hospital. However, Shri Amar Nath was number produced in defence to ascertain whether he had told this fact to the Medical Officer and if so how he acquired the said knowledge whether from the deceased or otherwise. Moreover, in the ruka Ex.PC sent by Dr. S.K. Gupta to the police there is numbermentioning of the bursting of stove, number it has been mentioned as to how he learnt that the deceased caught fire while working on a stove. It has simply been mentioned that the deceased was alleged to have sustained burns 70 while working on a stove. The word bursting is missing in this ruka, whereas, it was so stated by Dr. S.K. Gupta when he appeared in the witness box. If the story of bursting of stove came to his knowledge it is number known why he omitted to mention this fact in his ruka Ex. PC sent to the police. Taking into companysideration all the facts and circumstances I am of the definite view that the statement of Dr. S.K. Gupta to the effect that there was the history of burns allegedly sustained by the deceased due to bursting of stove while companyking food is number legally sound because neither Amar Nath was produced, number deceased companyld speak anything before her death. The appellant preferred an appeal. The High Court upheld the companyviction of the appellant while acquitting his mother Mohinder Kaur, the companyaccused, of the charge under Section 304-B, IPC but upheld her companyviction under Section 498A, IPC. It was observed that the allegation of demand of dowry soon before the death was only against the appellant and number against his mother. Rejecting the defence plea of accidental burning, the High Court observed as under Page 6 The accused or their persons might have accompanied Lavjeet Kaur to the hospital. The accused are naturally interested to save themselves from legal punishment and such as the said history might have been given by them or Amar Nath to save the accused. PW-2 Dr. S.K. Gupta has numberpersonal knowledge about the occurrence and has stated that there was history of burns sustained by Lavjeet Kaur due to bursting of stove while companyking food. So, that history was given by the accused or Amar Nath, accompanying the injured to the hospital. One another circumstance which militates against the case of the accused is that the police found the blood sustained Gadda in the room where the occurrence is stated to have taken place and number in the kitchen, as per stand of the accused. That fact belied the stand of accused. The statement of Dr. S.K. Gupta that history was given by the patient does number appeal to reason. The deceased was having 70 burn injuries and as such she was number in a position to narrate the occurrence. The police had numberreason to change the place of occurrence from the kitchen to the room as shown in the rough site plan. There were singeing of the skull hair of Lavjeet Kaur besides having burn injuries on the chest and lower part of the body. The fact of bursting of stove and giving the case history by Lavjeet Kaur is number mentioned by Dr. S.K. Gupta in the record. The doctor is number supposed to orally know all the facts. It seems that Dr. S.K. Gupta has stated that the history of the case was given by the patient simply to favour the accused, moreso when there is numberhing in this regard on the record. So, numberreliance can be placed on the statement made by Dr. S.K. Gupta, in this regard. PW-3 Dr. Gajinder Yadav, has stated that there was probability of the deceased receiving burn injuries by accidental fire but he has number stated it with companyfidence that in all probability, the death companyld be accidental, in the present case. That doctor has number seen the other circumstantial evidence at the spot before arriving at the companyclusion. So, the learned trial Court has rightly held that Lavjeet Kaur, deceased, has died due to Page 7 unnatural injuries and number by accidental burn injuries. We have heard learned companynsel for the parties and perused the evidence on the record. The main question raised for our companysideration is whether the evidence of demand of dowry soon before the death was reliable and whether it was a case of accidental death as pleaded by the defence. The presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act is attracted only in case of suicidal or homicidal death and number in case of an accidental death. We are unable to accept the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant. The brother and father of the deceased have made categorical allegation of demand of dowry which companyfirmed almost upto the date of death. Even though version of PW 4, brother of the deceased, and PW 5, father of the deceased, may be exaggerated to the extent of saying that they saw the accused and his mother causing burn injuries, there is numberreason to disbelieve their version with regard to demand of dowry. It is true that in case of accidental death presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act Page 8 is number available but there is numberreason to hold that in the present case, the burn injuries were by accident. Apart from the following reasons given by the trial Court and the High Court, namely The Investigating Officer found the plastic can  Exhibit P-1  smelling kerosene oil and a half burnt mattress  Exhibit P-2  The burst stove was number found at the place of occurrence as stated by the Investigating Officer The deceased suffered 70 burn injuries which was held to be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary companyrse of injury, there are other reasons to reject the plea of accident there are other reasons to support the findings. While in the case of homicidal death, if the victim is caught unaware, a person may number be able to make any effort to save himself herself and in case of suicidal burn injuries a person may take all precautions number to save himself herself, in case of accidental burn injuries, victim makes all possible efforts to save himself herself which may leave evidence to show that the death was accidental. Such a person may raise alarm and try to escape. The Investigating Officer visiting the scene of occurrence can numberice the available evidence by recreating the scene. In the present case, there are numberprobabilities to support the defence plea of accident, particularly when relations Page 9 between the deceased and the appellant were number harmonious. Thus, taking of plea by the accused to save himself herself is number enough. The companytention in the present case that PW 2-Dr. S.K. Gupta mentioned the history of burn due to bursting of stove was given by the patient and one Amar Nath who accompanied her is without any merit. In the same statement the said witness states that the victim was unfit to make a statement. Amar Nath, who is said to have given this information, has number been examined by the defence. Statement of Dr. S.K. Gupta that Amar Nath gave this information is hearsay. Moreover, PW 2-Dr. S.K. Gupta has been examined as an expert witness to give his opinion about the health companydition of the patient based on his expertise. He is number a witness of fact. Similarly, companytention that PW 3-Dr. Gajinder Yadav who companyducted the post mortem made a statement in cross examination that there was more probability of death being caused by accidental fire as there was numbersmell of kerosene oil from the body of the deceased and that the fire had started from the lower parts of the body towards upper parts is equally without any merit. Such statement of an expert witness without being based on any specialized knowledge cannot be accepted. Page 10 The opinion of expert witness on technical aspects has relevance but the opinion has to be based upon specialized knowledge and the data on which it is based has to be found acceptable by the Court. In Madan Gopal Kakkad versus Naval Dubey.1, it was observed as under A medical witness called in as an expert to assist the Court is number a witness of fact and the evidence given by the medical officer is really of an advisory character given on the basis of the symptoms found on examination. The expert witness is expected to put before the Court all materials inclusive of the data which induced him to companye to the companyclusion and enlighten the Court on the technical aspect of the case by explaining the terms of science so that the Court although, number an expert may form its own judgment on those materials after giving due regard to the experts opinion because once the experts opinion is accepted, it is number the opinion of the medical officer but of the Court. Nariman, J. in Queen v. Ahmed Ally.2, while expressing his view on medical evidence has observed as follows The evidence of a medical man or other skilled witnesses, however, eminent, as to what he thinks may or may number have taken place under particular companybination of circumstances, however, companyfidently, he may speak, is ordinarily a matter of mere opinion. We may also numbere that the presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act has been enacted to check the menace of the dowry deaths and in appreciating the evidence, the social background of the legislation cannot be  1992  3 SCC 204  1998  3 SCC 309 Page 11 ignored. In Pawan Kumar vs. State of Haryana.3, it was observed It is true, as argued by learned companynsel for the appellants, that in criminal jurisprudence benefit of doubt is extendable to the accused. But that benefit of doubt would arise in the companytext of the application of penal law, and in the facts and circumstances of a case. The companycept of benefit of doubt has an important role to play but within the companyfines of the stringency of laws. Since the cause of death of a married woman was to occur number in numbermal circumstances but as a dowry death, for which the evidence was number so easily available, as it is mostly companyfined within the four walls of a house, namely the husbands house, where all likely accused reside. Hence the aforesaid amendments brought in the companycept of deemed dowry death by the husband or the relatives, as the case may be. This deeming clause has a role to play and cannot be taken lightly and ignored to shield an accused, otherwise the very purpose of the amendment will be lost. Of companyrse, the prosecution has to prove the ultimate essential ingredients beyond all reasonable doubt after raising the initial presumption of deemed dowry death. Explanation to Section 304-B refers to dowry as having the same meaning as in Section 2 of the 1961 Act, the question is what is the periphery of the dowry as defined therein? The argument is, there has to be an agreement at the time of the marriage in view of the words agreed to be given occurring therein, and in the absence of any such evidence it would number companystitute to be a dowry. It is numbericeable, as this definition by amendment includes number only the period before and at the marriage but also the period subsequent to the marriage. When words in a statute are referable to more than one meaning, the established rule of companystruction is found in Heydons case1 also approved by this Court in Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. 11 WR Cr. 25 Page 12 State of Bihar2 AIR at p. 674. The rule is to companysider four aspects while companystruing an Act  a  what was the law prior to the law which is sought to be interpreted  b  what was the mischief or defect for which new law is made  c  what is the remedy the law number provides and  d  what is the reason of the remedy. The Court must adopt that companystruction which, suppresses the mischief and advances the remedy. Applying this principle, it is clear that the earlier law was number sufficient to check dowry deaths hence aforesaid stringent provisions were brought in, so that persons companymitting such inhuman crimes on married women should number escape, as evidence of a direct nature is number readily available except of the circumstantial kind. Hence it is that interpretation which suppresses the mischief, subserves the objective and advances the remedy, which would be acceptable. The objective is that men companymitting such crimes should number escape punishment. Hence stringent provisions were brought in by shifting the burden onto the accused by bringing in the deemed clause. As aforesaid, the definition of dowry was amended with effect from 19-11-1986, to include the period even after the marriage. The offence alleged against the appellants is under Section 304-B IPC which makes demand of dowry itself punishable. Demand neither companyceives number would companyceive of any agreement. If for companyvicting any offender, agreement for dowry is to be proved, hardly any offenders would companye under the clutches of law. When Section 304-B refers to demand of dowry, it refers to the demand of property or valuable security as referred to in the definition of dowry under the 1961 Act. It was argued on behalf of the appellants that mere demand of scooter or fridge would number be a demand for dowry. We find from the evidence on record that within a few days after the marriage, the deceased was tortured, maltreated Page 13 and harassed for number bringing the aforesaid articles in marriage. Hence the demand is in companynection with marriage. The argument that there is numberdemand of dowry, in the present case, has numberforce. In cases of dowry deaths and suicides, circumstantial evidence plays an important role and inferences can be drawn on the basis of such evidence. That companyld be either direct or indirect. It is significant that Section 4 of the 1961 Act, was also amended by means of Act 63 of 1984, under which it is an offence to demand dowry directly or indirectly from the parents or other relatives or guardian of a bride. The word agreement referred to in Section 2 has to be inferred on the facts and circumstances of each case. The interpretation that the appellant seeks, that companyviction can only be if there is agreement for dowry, is misconceived. This would be companytrary to the mandate and object of the Act. Dowry definition is to be interpreted with the other provisions of the Act including Section 3, which refers to giving or taking dowry and Section 4 which deals with penalty for demanding dowry, under the 1961 Act and the Indian Penal Code. This makes it clear that even demand of dowry on other ingredients being satisfied is punishable. This leads to the inference, when persistent demands for TV and scooter are made from the bride after marriage or from her parents, it would companystitute to be in companynection with the marriage and it would be a case of demand of dowry within the meaning of Section 304-B IPC. It is number always necessary that there be any agreement for dowry. Again in Hira Lal vs. State  Govt. of NCT , Delhi.4, it was observed as under Section 304-B IPC which deals with dowry death, reads as follows 304-B. Dowry death.  1  Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under numbermal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any  2003  8 SCC 80 Page 14 relative of her husband for, or in companynection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called dowry death, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death. Explanation.For the purpose of this sub- section, dowry shall have the same meaning as in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961  28 of 1961 . Whoever companymits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall number be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life. The provision has application when death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under numbermal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relatives of her husband for, or in companynection with any demand for dowry. In order to attract application of Section 304-B IPC, the essential ingredients are as follows The death of a woman should be caused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under a numbermal circumstance. Such a death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage. She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband. Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in companynection with demand of dowry. Such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out to the woman soon before her death. Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is also relevant for the case at hand. Both Section 304-B IPC and Section 113-B of the Evidence Act were inserted as numbered earlier by Dowry Prohibition  Amendment  Act 43 of 1986 with a view to companybat the increasing menace of dowry deaths. Section 113-B reads as follows 113-B. Presumption as to dowry death.When the question is whether a person has companymitted the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in companynection with, any demand for dowry, Page 15 the Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death. Explanation.For the purposes of this section, dowry death shall have the same meaning as in Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code  45 of 1860 . The necessity for insertion of the two provisions has been amply analysed by the Law Commission of India in its 21st Report dated 10-8-1988 on Dowry Deaths and Law Reform. Keeping in view the impediment in the pre-existing law in securing evidence to prove dowry-related deaths, the legislature thought it wise to insert a provision relating to presumption of dowry death on proof of certain essentials. It is in this background that presumptive Section 113-B in the Evidence Act has been inserted. As per the definition of dowry death in Section 304-B IPC and the wording in the presumptive Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, one of the essential ingredients, amongst others, in both the provisions is that the woman companycerned must have been soon before her death subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in companynection with the demand of dowry. Presumption under Section 113-B is a presumption of law. On proof of the essentials mentioned therein, it becomes obligatory on the companyrt to raise a presumption that the accused caused the dowry death. The presumption shall be raised only on proof of the following essentials The question before the companyrt must be whether the accused has companymitted the dowry death of the woman.  This means that the presumption can be raised only if the accused is being tried for the offence under Section 304-B IPC.  The woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his relatives. Such cruelty or harassment was for or in companynection with any demand for dowry. Such cruelty or harassment was soon before her death. A companyjoint reading of Section 113-B of the Evidence Act and Section 304-B IPC shows that there must be material to show that soon before her death the victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment. The prosecution has to rule out the Page 16 possibility of a natural or accidental death so as to bring it within the purview of death occurring otherwise than in numbermal circumstances. The expression soon before is very relevant where Section 113-B of the Evidence Act and Section 304-B IPC are pressed into service. The prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the occurrence there was cruelty or harassment and only in that case presumption operates. Evidence in that regard has to be led by the prosecution. Soon before is a relative term and it would depend upon the circumstances of each case and numberstraitjacket formula can be laid down as to what would companystitute a period of soon before the occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate any fixed period, and that brings in the importance of a proximity test both for the proof of an offence of dowry death as well as for raising a presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act. The expression soon before her death used in the substantive Section 304-B IPC and Section 113-B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. No definite period has been indicated and the expression soon before is number defined. A reference to the expression soon before used in Section 114 Illustration  a  of the Evidence Act is relevant. It lays down that a companyrt may presume that a man who is in the possession of goods soon after the theft, is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for their possession. The determination of the period which can companye within the term soon before is left to be determined by the companyrts, depending upon facts and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression soon before would numbermally imply that the interval should number be much between the cruelty or harassment companycerned and the death in question. There must be existence of a proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the death companycerned. If the alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has become stale enough number to disturb the mental equilibrium of the woman companycerned, it would be of numberconsequence. Page 17 Having regard to the entirety of material, we do number find any ground to interfere with the companycurrent finding recorded by the companyrts below that it was number a case of accidental death but a death taking place in circumstances other than numbermal. Thus, the presumption under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act has been rightly invoked and the offence against the appellant has been proved. There is numbertangible circumstance to rebut the presumption. For the above reasons, we do number find any merit in this appeal. The appeal is dismissed. The appellant who is on bail is directed to surrender to custody to undergo the remaining sentence. J. GOPALA GOWDA J.

Mrs. Vivekta Singh, Adv.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n","O R D E R Arising out of S.L.P.  Criminal  No. 3254 of 2004 Leave granted. Heard appellants companynsel and companynsel for the respondent. Appellant herein is an accused in a crime registered for the offence under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code. The appellant filed a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code to quash the criminal proceedings initiated against him. The learned Single Judge declined to quash the proceedings and hence this appeal. One Pranab Kumar Nag was an employee of M s M.L. Dalmiya Co. Ltd. During the companyrse of his employment, he had been posted at various work sites of the companypany and on 11.9.1999 he was transferred to the work site of the companypanys stores located at 160, L. Saha Road, Kolkata. It seems that pursuant to the transfer order, Pranab Kumar Nag did number join duty and after a period of about two years he sent in a letter of resignation written in his own hand wherein he expressed his grievance of stagnancy of salary and also alleged that he was a victim of unfortunate circumstances. The companypany accepted his resignation with immediate effect. On 16.2.2001, a dead body was found at the railway tracks near Ballygunge railway station and it was revealed that it was the body of Pranab Kumar Nag. His brother went to the office where Pranab Kumar Nag had worked and made enquires. The dead body of Pranab Kumar Nag was released to his brother after the post-mortem examination on 19.2.2001. After a period of two months, a companyplaint was lodged before the police post on the basis of a suicide numbere allegedly recovered from the dead body of Pranab Kumar Nag. Based on the companyplaint, a case was registered against the appellant and some others. A translated companyy of the suicide numbere is produced before us by the appellant. We have carefully read the alleged suicide numbere. The substance of this suicide numbere is that deceased Pranab Kumar Nag alleged that appellant Netai Dutta and one Paramesh Chatterjee engaged him in several wrong-doings  he has shown as a type of torture  and at the end of the letter, a reference is also made to Paramesh Chatterjee and Netai Dutta alleging that he reported certain incidents to them. A reading of the letter would show that deceased Pranab Kumar Nag was number very much satisfied with the working companyditions in the office. In the letter he has stated that he had to be at the work place sometimes throughout the day and night and he had to remain in the companypany of some drivers who had been sometimes in drunken companydition at about one o clock or two o clock in the night. It is also alleged that the drivers who had been present at the work place had been having number-vegetarian food. He also companyplained that he had to work even on Sundays. He further stated that one day he companyld leave the work place at 8 o clock in the evening and all the restaurants were closed and that he reported the matter to the present appellant. There is absolutely numberaverment in the alleged suicide numbere that the present appellant had caused any harm to him or was in any way responsible for delay in paying salary to deceased Pranab Kumar Nag. It seems that the deceased was very much dissatisfied with the working companyditions at the work place. But, it may also be numbericed that the deceased after his transfer in 1999 had never joined the office at 160 B.L. Saha Road, Kolkata and had absented himself for a period of two years and that the suicide took place on 16.2.2001. It cannot be said that the present appellant had in any way instigated the deceased to companymit suicide or he was responsible for the suicide of Pranab Kumar Nag. An offence under Section 306 IPC would stand only if there is an abetment for the companymission of the crime. The parameters of the abetment have been stated in Section 107 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 107 says that a person abets the doing of a thing, who instigates any person to do that thing or engages with one or more other person or persons in any companyspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that companyspiracy, or the person should have intentionally aided any act or illegal omission. The explanation to Section 107 says that any willful misrepresentation or willful companycealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, may also companye within the companytours of abetment. In the suicide numbere, except referring to the name of the appellant at two places, there is numberreference of any act or incidence whereby the appellant herein is alleged to have companymitted any willful act or omission or intentionally aided or instigated the deceased Pranab Kumar Nag in companymitting the act of suicide. There is numbercase that the appellant has played any part or any role in any companyspiracy, which ultimately instigated or resulted in the companymission of suicide by deceased Pranab Kumar Nag. Apart from the suicide numbere, there is numberallegation made by the companyplainant that the appellant herein in any way was harassing his brother, Pranab Kumar Nag. The case registered against the appellant is without any factual foundation. The companytents of the alleged suicide numbere do number in any way make out the offence against the appellant. The prosecution initiated against the appellant would only result in sheer harassment to the appellant without any fruitful result. In our opinion, the learned Single Judge seriously erred in holding that the First Information Report against the appellant disclosed the elements of a companynizable offence. There was absolutely numberground to proceed against the appellant herein.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n"," B. Sinha, J. Leave granted. Application of the term soon before her death occurring in Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code  IPC for short  in the facts and circumstances of the present case is the question involved herein. Asha Devi  the deceased  was married to the appellant. The date of their marriage, however, is in dispute viz. whether the same had taken place in the year 1983 or in the year 1987. Asha Devi was found dead on 8.12.1993 having suffered extensive burn injuries. On or about 8.12.1993 at about 5.10 p.m., a First Information Report  FIR for short  was lodged against the appellant and his family members by Ajmer Singh  P.W.1.  , brother of the deceased, inter alia alleging I, Ajmer Singh s o Ranbahadur Singh R o Nigohi, S. Deeh Janpad Raebareli, my elder sister Asha Devi was married in 1987 with Suresh Kumar Singh s o Manbodh Singh at village Budhwar, P.S. Deeh, Janpad Raebareli. After marriage my brother in law, his younger brother and sister Kusuma were harassing her and asking for dowry. My brother in law demanded Rs.5000/- at the time of marriage of his sister. This was told by my sister and gave the money. Thereafter demand for more money, ring and chain was made, in this regard she was burnt year ago. I had got her treated and had asked her to live today on 8.12.1993 at about 12O clock. One unknown person who is her neighbour came to my house and informed that your sister has been done to death and her dead body is lying and are preparing to cremate her. I reached the site and saw my sister who was lying burnt and dead. I believe that Suresh Singh, Zilajeet Singh S o Manbodh Singh and their elder sister Kusuma D o Manbodh Singh S o Budhwar, S. Deeh, Distt. Raebareli have burnt and killed my sister. Therefore, you are requested to lodge report and prosecute. We may furthermore numberice the injuries found by the Autopsy Surgeon in his post mortem examination on the body of the deceased, which are as under I to III degree burn on front and back of skull, neck, front and side of whole chest with upper part of abdomen, let axilla and whole arm and back of shoulder and scapular region, with exholate and pus companying out from right elbow region. Total burn about 40. In the opinion of the doctor, the cause of death is shock as a result of ante mortem burn injuries. The Investigating Officer filed a charge sheet. Cognizance was taken under Section 304B and Section 498A of the IPC. The prosecution in support of its case examined four witnesses. The companytention raised on behalf of the appellant were  1  that the death of the deceased occurred by way of an accident  2  the marriage having taken place in the year 1983 that is number within a period of seven years from the date of her death, Sections 498A and 304B of the IPC were number applicable. By reason of a judgment and order dated 30.4.1996, the learned trial judge while acquitting Smt. Kusuma Devi and Zila Jeet Singh companyvicted the appellant under Section 304B and 498A of the IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years for the offence under Section 304B IPC and to undergo three years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.2000/- for the offence under Section 498A IPC inter alia holding The marriage had taken place in the year 1987. The prosecution has number been able to prove demand of dowry from the family members of the deceased. Appellant had made an attempt to cause burn injuries to her one year prior to the date of occurrence. An appeal preferred thereagainst by the appellant has been dismissed by reason of the impugned judgment. Mr. Naveen Kumar Singh, learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the appellant inter alia would submit that the trial companyrt and companysequently the High Court companymitted a serious error in passing the impugned judgments insofar as they failed to take into companysideration that sufficient evidence had been brought on record to show that marriage took place in the year 1983 and number in the year 1987 and, thus, numberpresumption as envisaged in Section 113A or Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1972 companyld have been invoked. No evidence having been adduced to show that the deceased was subjected to any cruelty soon before her death, the impugned judgments are unsustainable. Mr. Pramod Swarup, learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, would urge In view of the companycurrent findings of fact arrived at by the two companyrts below, numberinterference therewith by this Court is warranted. The term soon before her death do number envisage any fixed term and appropriate meaning should be assigned thereto having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case. As demand of dowry had been made and an attempt was also made to cause burn injuries to her one year prior to the incident in question, the impugned judgments are unassailable. Before adverting to the legal companytentions raised herein, we may numberice the deposition of the first informant - Ajmer Singh. According to him, the marriage took place sometime in April - May 1987. Dowry demands of the family of the appellant companyld number be fulfilled at that time. One month after the marriage, she came back to her maternal home and told her mother and other female members that the appellant and his family members had demanded a chain and a ring and also assaulted her. Six months thereafter allegedly while Gauna ceremony was being performed, he was informed by the deceased that they should give her a ring and a chain as otherwise the appellant would kill her. He was informed by daughter of Maiku who was married in the village of appellant that one year before the death of the deceased, accused persons had burnt her. She had brought the deceased and got her treated by Dr. Chedi Singh. Accused persons did number provide her any treatment and the deceased had a big wound. After healing she sent the deceased back with the companysin of appellant and thereafter the deceased was in the house of her husband for six months. In his cross-examination, however, he accepted that the appellant was married only to Asha Devi alone. He denied the suggestion that the marriage took place 14 years prior thereto. In answer to a question as to the name of Shiv Kumari was entered in the voter list of 1988 as the wife of the appellant, he stated as under I do number know how the name of Shiv Kumari is entered in the voter list of 1988 as the wife of Suresh Kumar Singh. I do number know that Shiv Kumari w o Suresh Kumar Singh was elected as member of village Sabha. He did number have any document to show that he had made arrangements for treatment of his sister. He was examined on 16.8.1995. Indisputably, on or about 5.9.1995, an application was filed by him for companyrection of his statement, which reads as under- It is submitted that on 16.08.95 statement of Applicant Ajmer Singh S o Ran Bahadur Singh, R o Village Nigohi, P.S. Deeh, District Raibareilly was recorded. In Para 3 at Page 4 of the statement it has been written that, In our place the name of girl is changed soon after companying to her in-laws house, after marriage, whereas actually Applicant had deposed that, At our place the name of girl is number changed soon after companying to her in-laws house after marriage. Hence, in the interest of justice, the amendment of the same to this effect is necessary. Hence, it is prayed that in the statement is number changed shall be read in place of is changed. Thus, he had accepted in his first deposition that a custom with regard to change of the name of the bride by her in-laws prevails in his companymunity. Indisputably, in the voters list of 1983, the name of wife of appellant was shown as Raj Kumari. There appears to be a companytroversy in regard to existence of a custom of changing the name of the bride by her husbands family. P.W.1, who is elder brother of the deceased even companyld number point out as to in which month the marriage had taken place. When the defence had raised a companytention with regard to the date of marriage, it was obligatory on the part of the prosecution to prove the same in order to take the benefit of the provisions companytained in Section 113A and 113B of the Indian Evidence Act as also the provisions of Section 498A and 304B of the IPC. Before a person is found guilty of companymission of an offence, the companyrt must arrive at a firm companyclusion that the ingredients thereof had been proved. For the said purpose whereas on the one hand the object of the Parliament in inserting the said provisions must be borne in mind a satisfaction must also be arrived at that the companyditions precedent therefor has been fulfilled. A voters list is a public document. It is issued under the authority of the Election Commission. The voters list published as on 1st January 1988 showed that Suresh Kumar Singh and Shiv Kumari were husband and wife and were resident of House No. 85. Their names along with one Ishraj Kumari were shown at Serial Nos. 273, 274 and 275. The husbands name of Shiv Kumari is shown as that of the appellant. The voters list was in relation to the residents of Dostpur, Budhwara. It is in the aforementioned background, the companyrt should have companysidered the purported application for amendment of statement filed by Ajmer Singh on 5.9.1995. On what basis such an amendment was directed is number borne out from the records. The learned Sessions Judge, however, relied thereupon to hold that the marriage had taken place in the year 1987. Keeping in view the menace of dowry deaths, the Parliament in the year 1983 inserted Section 498A of the IPC and Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act by Act No. 46 of 1983 and in the year 1986 inserted Section 304B of the IPC and Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act by Act No. 43 of 1986. Although Section 304B of the IPC came into force with effect from 19th November 1986, Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act came into force with effect from 5.1.1986. The learned trial judge as also the High Court invoked Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, which reads as under 113B. Presumption as to dowry death.- When the question is whether a person has companymitted the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman has been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in companynection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death. Explanation.-For the purposes of this section dowry death shall have the same meaning as in section 304B, of the Indian Penal Code  45 of 1860 . The definition of dowry death is incorporated by reference to Section 304B of the IPC, which reads as under 304B. Dowry death.-  1  Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under numbermal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in companynection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called dowry death, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death. Explanation.--For the purpose of this sub-section, dowry shall have the same meaning as in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961  28 of 1961 . Whoever companymits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall number be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life. Explanation appended to Section 304B defines dowry to have the same meaning as companytained in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, which reads as under Definition of dowry.- In this Act, dowry means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly-  a  by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage or  b  by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before or any time after the marriage in companynection with the marriage of the said parties, but does number include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law  Shariat  applied. We may also numberice the provisions of Section 498A of the IPC, which reads as under- 498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.- Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.--For the purpose of this section, cruelty means--  a  any wilful companyduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to companymit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health  whether mental or physical  of the woman or  b  harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to companyrcing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any properly or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand. One of the ingredients of Section 304B of the IPC is marriage within a period of seven years preceding the death. No such requirement finds place in Section 498A thereof. From the evidence of P.W.1, it appears that he had talked of only one incident in respect whereof his evidence was admissible in law, that is, when the deceased came back to her parental home six months after Gauna ceremony, she had informed him that if he did number give a ring and a chain, the accused persons might kill her. It is also number in dispute that the matter rested at that as he talked to the appellant in that behalf, whereafter he came and took her away. The matter was therefore settled. There was numberhing to show that any cruelty or harassment was meted out on that ground thereafter. So far as the other incident disclosed by him is companycerned, it was one which he had heard from his wife and other female members of the family. It was, thus, hearsay, as they were number examined. It is in the aforementioned companytext, we may companysider the effect of the term soon before death. Section 304B of the Code provides for a penal offence. It has the following ingredients The death of a woman must have been caused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under numbermal circumstances Such death must have occurred within seven years from the date of the marriage Soon before her death, the woman must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband and Such cruelty or harassment must be in companynection with the demand of dowry. The harassment which is said to have been caused in companynection with the demand of dowry other than the incident in question, as numbericed hereinbefore, was one year prior to the incident. Would a gap of one year would answer the description of term soon before her death is the question. We may, at the outset, numberice some case laws operating in the field. In Satvir Singh and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr.  2001  8 SCC 633, this Court held It is number enough that harassment or cruelty was caused to the woman with a demand for dowry at some time, if Section 304B is to be invoked. But it should have happened soon before her death. The said phrase, numberdoubt, is an elastic expression and can refer to a period either immediately before her death or within a few days or even a few weeks before it. But the proximity to her death is the pivot indicated by that expression. The legislative object in providing such a radius of time by employing the words soon before her death is to emphasis the idea that her death should, in all probabilities, have been the aftermath of such cruelty or harassment. In other words, there should be a perceptible nexus between her death and the dowry related harassment or cruelty inflicted on her. If the interval elapsed between the infliction of such harassment or cruelty and her death is wide the companyrt would be in a position to gauge that in all probabilities the death would number have been the immediate cause of her death. It is hence for the companyrt to decide, on the facts and circumstances of each case, whether the said interval in that particular case was sufficient to snuff its companyd from the companycept soon before her death. See also Harjit Singh vs. State of Punjab  2006  1 SCC 463 Indisputably, in order to attract the said provision, it is imperative on the part of the prosecution to establish that the cruelty or harassment has been meted out to the deceased soon before her death. There cannot be any doubt or dispute that it is a flexible term. Its application would depend upon the factual matrix obtaining in a particular case. No fix period can be indicated therefor. It, however, must undergo the test known as proximity test. What, however, is necessary for the prosecution is to bring on record that the dowry demand was number too late and number too stale before the death of the victim. A similar question came up for companysideration in Thakkan Jha Ors. vs. State of Bihar  2004  13 SCC 348, wherein this Court held This is so because the expression used in the relevant provision is soon before. The expression is a relative term which is required to be companysidered under specific circumstances of each case and numberstraitjacket formula can be laid down by fixing any time-limit. The expression is pregnant with the idea of proximity test. It cannot be said that the term soon before is synonymous with the term immediately before. This is because of what is stated in Section 114 Illustration  a  of the Evidence Act. The determination of the period which can companye within the term soon before is left to be determined by the companyrts, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression soon before would numbermally imply that the interval should number be much between the cruelty or harassment companycerned and the death in question. There must be existence of a proximate and live link. See also Baldev Singh vs. State of Punjab  2008  13 SCC 233 Yet again in Kamesh Panjiyar Alias Kamlesh Panjiyar vs. State of Bihar  2005  2 SCC 388, this Court held The expression soon before is very relevant where Section 113B of the Evidence Act and Section 304B IPC are pressed into service. Prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the occurrence there was cruelty or harassment and only in that case presumption operates. Evidence in that regard has to be led by prosecution. Soon before is a relative term and it would depend upon circumstances of each case and numberstrait-jacket formula can be laid down as to what would companystitute a period of soon before the occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate any fixed period, and that brings in the importance of a proximity test both for the proof of an offence of dowry death as well as for raising a presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act. The expression soon before her death used in the substantive Section 304B IPC and Section 113B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. This Court in Ram Badan Sharma vs. State of Bihar  2006  10 SCC 115 wherein one of us was a Member, held There are three main ingredients of this offence  a  that, there is a demand of dowry and harassment by the accused on that companynt  b  that, the deceased died and  c  that, the death is under unnatural circumstances within seven years of the marriage. When these factors were proved by reliable and companyent evidence, then the presumption of dowry death under Section 113B of the Evidence Act clearly arose. The aforementioned ingredients necessarily attract Section 304B IPC. Section 304B is a special provision which was inserted by an amendment of 1986 to deal with a large number of dowry deaths taking place in the companyntry. In the instant case, if the circumstances of the case are analyzed on the touchstone of Section 304B IPC, all the three basic ingredients of Section 304B I.P.C. are present in the instant case. There has been persistent demand of dowry and harassment, humiliation and physical violence and beating by the husband and her in-laws. The deceased died under unnatural circumstances within seven years of the marriage. See also Devi Lal vs. State of Rajasthan 2007  12  SCALE 265  para 20 , and State of Rajasthan vs. Jaggu Ram 2008  1  SCALE 22  para 11  The Law Commission submitted its 91st Report on Dowry Deaths and Law Reforms Amending Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 wherein it was emphasized that there had been an alarming increase in the number of cases in which married woman die in circumstances which, to say the least, are highly suspicious. Those deaths popularly came to be associated with dowry and that is why it was given the term dowry death Some harassment which had taken place one year prior to the death without something more, in our opinion, companyld number have been companysidered to be a cruelty which had been inflicted soon before the death of the deceased. It does number satisfy the proximity test. As the death, in our opinion, had number taken place within a period of seven years and there is numberevidence that any cruelty has been inflicted upon the deceased soon before her death neither the presumption in terms of Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act companyld have been drawn number it companyld be companycluded that the appellant is guilty of companymission of offence under Section 304B.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n"," M. JOSEPH, J. The appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1475 of 2009 is the first accused and the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1476 of 2009 is the second accused. They were charged under Sections 306 read with Section 34 Signature Not Verified and Section 304B read with Section 34 of the Indian Digitally signed by RACHNA Date 2019.07.23 173527 IST Reason Penal Code, 1860  hereinafter referred to as the IPC for short . The first accused is the son of the second accused. It Is the case of the prosecution in brief that the first accused used to treat his wife with cruelty on account of dowry demand. The same allegation was made against his father-second accused. It is also alleged that his father wanted to fulfil his lust with his daughter-in-law. She did number agree. The accused tortured her and gave her beating. The daughter-in-law companymitted suicide by burning herself on 05.06.1991. After companyplying with the formalities, the charge-sheet was filed against the accused. Prosecution examined nine witnesses and produced 17 documents. The Trial Court came to the companyclusion that the prosecution failed to prove the case against both the accused. They were accordingly acquitted. Reliance is in particular placed on certain letters. The appeal carried against their acquittal by the State was allowed by the High Court by the impugned order. The appellants were companyvicted under Section 304B read with Section 34 of the IPC. It was, however, found that offence under Section 306 read with Section 34 of the IPC was number made out against the appellants. The appellants were sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment. We have heard learned companynsel for the appellants and learned companynsel for the State. Learned companynsel for the appellants would submit that numbercase is made out under Section 304B read with Section 34 of the IPC. He would submit that the High Court has reversed the verdict of acquittal and companyvicted the appellants ignoring the fact that the prosecution witnesses were unreliable. Prosecution witnesses, it is companyplained, have improved their version while they gave evidence in the witness box. Contradictions emerging from their previous statements under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973  hereinafter referred to as the Cr.PC for short , demonstrated that their testimony in companyrt, which is relied upon by the High Court, companyld number be the basis for reversal of acquittal. Reliance is placed on certain letters as well. We have also heard the learned companynsel for the State who supported the judgment by pointing out that there was evidence to justify the companyviction. Before we companysider the evidence, it is apposite that we set out the following findings rendered by the High Court Just before her death and after 5-6 months of her marriage, respondents-accused Girish Singh and Jodh Singh harassed the deceased Ishwari Devi for getting T.V. and V.C.R. in dowry and by number-fulfilling the demand of dowry, they were companytinuously beating her. Respondent Jodh Singh also harassed her by saying her to provide him liquor in the glass and after taking liquor in the state of intoxication, he was asking her to sleep with him. On her refusal, she was subjected to mental cruelty. P.W. 4 Ganesh Singh has specifically stated that after companying back from Mumbai, he came to know that respondent-accused Jodh Singh after taking the liquor was trying to companymit rape with Ishwari and also used to harass her for T.V. and V.C.R., due to which his daughter Parvati Devi, P.W. 2 Smt. Laxmi Devi, P.W. 3 Smt. Anandi Devi, P.W. 4 Ganesh Singh, and P.W. 5 Yasodh Singh, it is proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution that Ishwari Devi was harassed for the demand of T.V. and V.C.R. in dowry by the respondents after 5-6 months of marriage and they were companytinuously making demand of dowry just before her death . Therefore, in view of the aforesaid discussion, it is proved that deceased Ishwari Devi died an unnatural death within 1 years of her marriage in the house of respondents where she was residing along with her husband- Girish Singh and father in law Jodh Singh. Deceased Ishwari Devi has died due to the burn injuries and her body was found to be 100 burnt by the Medical Officer P.W. 9 Dr. P.K. Karnatak. As such, it has been proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was subjected to mental cruelty by the respondents for the demand of T.V. and C.R. in dowry and due to number-fulfilment of this demand and due to the harassment and Marpit by the respondents, Ishwari Devi companymitted suicide by burning herself in the house of her husband. Hence, in view of the above-said facts and circumstances of the case, offence punishable u s 304-B/34 of IPC is fully made out against the respondents beyond reasonable doubt and learned Sessions Judge has erred in law by acquitting the respondents u s 304-B r w Section 34 IPC. Thereafter, the High Court proceeds to hold that the Sessions Judge erred in holding that the oral evidence is number supported by the documentary evidence. After referring to Section 113B of The Evidence Act, 1872, it is found that a presumption is to be drawn under the said provision that dowry death has been caused. The finding by the Trial Court that the cruelty to his wife by the first accused is number proved, was found to be incorrect. Still further, it is found that the Trial Court erred in finding that the deceased ran away to her fathers house where she companymitted suicide. The deceased companymitted suicide in the house of the appellants. In regard to the letters produced by the appellants to show that there was numbercruelty, it is found that the actual letters, which show the cruelty, written by the deceased companyld number be produced due to the reason that as submitted by PW4 as they were misplaced due to the shifting of the house. The companytradictions in the statements made by the prosecution witnesses also did number appeal to the High Court. It was found that the deposition given by the prosecution witnesses was reliable and trustworthy. Now, the time is ripe for us to companysider what prosecution witnesses have deposed. PW1 is the sister of the deceased. She is shown as 14 years old on the date of deposition. She states that whenever the deceased sister used to companye to her house, she used to tell her that father-in-law of the deceased and her husband companyplained about bringing numberdowry and used to say that companyour television was number given. Father-in-law would companysume liquor and ask her to stand in front of her and sleep with him. When sister did number act like that, he used to beat her up. The mother of the witness used to pacify her and sent her to her matrimonial home. She had gone 7-8 times to see her sister to the matrimonial home. They used to ask her sister how she has companye without dowry. In the cross-examination she would, inter alia, state as follows The witness went to leave her sister last time to her matrimonial house about three months back. Her grandmother was also with her. No report was given anywhere regarding beating to grandmother by the accused. It is further stated that her sister was influenced by devta  religious spirit . Then her matrimonial home companyducted religious ceremony for her. Her sister became numbermal after companyducting it. Whatever madness her sister used to do it was taken care of by her in-laws house. Only prayers were offered. First accused did number have a good opinion about her sister. Her sister held him good but he did number respond. Sister used to tell about aforesaid facts of companysuming liquor to stand in front of him and to sleep with him. Yashodh Singh is her uncle. These facts were number told to her uncle by them. She was examined by Kanungo  Officer . In regard to her statement under Section 161 of the Cr.PC that deceased was alright till 5-6 months after her marriage in the matrimonial home, she denied making that statement. She denies making the statement that the deceased used to run away to their house. She says she has stated to Kanungo that the second accused used to beat her sister. She states that if the Officer has number written it, she cannot give the reason. About the sister weeping while companyplaining and such statement number being found, the witness says that she has told the Kanungo. The witness stated that she cannot say the reason why it is number written. Again, statement that her mother used to send back the deceased after pacifying her, it is stated that regarding the omission, it is her version that it was stated to Kanungo.  Emphasis supplied  PW-2 is the mother of the deceased. She states, inter alia, that the appellants used to tell the deceased that television and VCR were number given in dowry. The accused appellant used to say to the deceased that she is chipri  flattened numbere  and number of their choice. They used to threaten her that they will burn her by pouring kerosene oil if she did number bring television and VCR. These facts were disclosed to her by the deceased. The second accused, in the presence of the witness, said that if television and VCR were number brought, she would be finished even before companying of her father to house. Her daughter had told her that in the absence of the first accused, the second accused would ask her to serve liquor and to sleep with him after being drunk. When she refused, he used to beat her up and show her khukri  knife . Accused had seen the deceased before marriage. Thereafter, marriage was solemnized. They had number promised to give television and VCR. In the cross- examination, she would, inter alia, state that Her daughter lived happily for 5-6 months of marriage. Thereafter, disturbances started. About one year disturbances remained. For about 5-6 months, deceased did number make companyplaint of her in-laws. The first accused used to roam in search of job. When deceased came to their house before her death, she was talked badly and was beaten up. Her statement was taken three times. She is an illiterate. She had told all the facts to Patwari in a statement. She cannot state the reason if the fact of television and VCR is number being written. She further says that deceased used to run away to their house after 5-6 months and they used to ask her number to run away. Her daughter loved her husband but he did number love her. She was companyfronted with the statement recorded by Patwari  Patwari performs the function of Police in certain parts of State of Uttarakhand  that she had never stated about harassment or beatings or bringing less dowry by her husband. She denied having made the statement. She is unable to tell the reason how the statement is written. She is again companyfronted with the statement that she had numbersuspicion about abetment or killing or about any harassment by her husband. She would say that the statement has been wrongly written by the Patwari Kanungo. Her husband has never companye during vacations after marriage of the deceased before her death. He has visited twice after her death. She says deceased has written about her grief in one year of her marriage to her father. She deposed that the deceased was an illiterate and she did number know how to read or write. Deceased had companye a week before her death to their house. She had informed Yasodh Singh about the grief of the deceased and all the facts on getting an information about the death. She has stated about the deceased being called chipri and number being liked and about number bringing television and VCR to the Kanungo. She says, if he has number written, she has numberreason to offer. Even the statement that second accused had stated in her presence that if the deceased did number bring television and VCR, then, she and her parents would be killed, was found missing in the statement and she has numberreason for the same. She claims to have made the statement. Showing of khukri by the second accused is found missing for which she had numberreason except saying that she has numberreason for the same number being written. No doubt she claims to have stated number She would say about the second accused companysuming liquor and asking the deceased to sleep with him, she was told this by the deceased and PW1 has number told these facts to her  be it numbered that PW1 has categorically stated that she has told these things to her mother, viz., PW2 . Suggestion is made that the deceased became restless due to influence of evil spirit which is numberdoubt denied by the witness.  Emphasis supplied  PW-3 is the grandmother of the deceased. She repeated what is stated by PWs 1 and 2, namely, that accused after marriage, asked the deceased to bring television and she would say that they told her that she was chipri. They used to beat her up when she was sent back and when she came home, she used to pacify her and sent back to her matrimonial home. Once when she went to leave the deceased, then, the second accused beat her 2-3 times on the chest of the granddaughter. Deceased used to tell her mother and sister that the second accused companysumed liquor, asked her to serve liquor and thereafter to sleep with her. She would be beaten up when she refused to sleep. She was asked to bring television. In the cross- examination, it is stated that deceased was chipri since beginning. In-laws of the deceased had good behaviour with her till two months. The deceased lived properly till six months. She used to do all household works and she used to run away from matrimonial home after 6-7 months. Her daughter-in-law PW2 did number go to the house of the second accused for patch up. Deceased had told the fact of demand of television 6-7 months before her death to her mother. In regard to there being numberstatement by her to the Patwari that second accused used to beat the deceased, she would say that she had told him. She says that the deceased has number told her that her father-in-law, with an intent to rape her, used to scold her. She had given statement to the Patwari that the deceased used to tell her mother about the father-in-law scolding her with an intent to rape her. Regarding the omission about the statement that in her presence, the second accused used to beat the deceased badly and that he was inclined to beat her up, she is unable to tell the reason. Upon her statement that the second accused beat the deceased three times on her chest and was inclined to beat her also, number being found on the statement, she is unable to give any reason. But according to her, she had told the Patwari this. PW-4 is the father of the deceased. He would state, inter alia, that the first accused had asked to give television and VCR in marriage but he told that he companyld give only to the extent of his ability. Marriage was solemnized in his presence when he came during his yearly vacations. After 5-6 days of marriage, when he was going back and the first accused came to take the deceased, then, he told him about television and VCR number being given. After five months of numbermal behaviour, accused started misbehaving. His daughter companyld read and write a little and she had written about the television and VCR, bad language and abuse, in those letters  PW-2-mother of the deceased, on the other hand, be it numbered, stated that the deceased was illiterate and companyld number read and write . On receiving information about the murder of his daughter, he was told about the companyplete incident by his family members. On this, he came to know about the second accused being drunk, trying to rape the deceased and harassing for television and VCR and for that reason, his daughter companymitted suicide. Regarding letters written by his daughter, they were lost during shifting of house. Prior to the marriage of his daughter, the first accused has number seen the deceased. He has also number seen the first accused his son-in-law before marriage. The first accused came on the second day after the barat returned  marriage gathering . He came in the evening and returned next day morning. The first accused and the deceased came after 5-6 days after marriage. When they came after 5-6 days after marriage, he was on duty  in chief examination, it may be remembered that the witness says that when he was going back after 5-6 days of marriage, the first accused came to take his daughter and then the first accused had companyplained that the television and VCR had number being given and the he stated that he had given according to his ability and if everything goes fine, it will also be done . He admits to have received only letter K3 from second accused. He states that there is numbermention of harassment for dowry but they used bad language and harassment. He admits to have written and signing two letters marked as Kha1 and Kha2 and is unable to explain why any fact of dowry harassment has number been written in these letters. He admits that these letters were written in response to letters by deceased. Confronted with the omission to mention about the demand for VCR, the companying of the son-in-law after 5-6 days after marriage and demand of dowry, he is unable to state the reason why they are number written. According to him, he has told the Kanungo. PW-5 is relative of the deceased. He says that deceased would tell all the facts to her mother about the harassment regarding television and VCR in dowry. He was also told he says. He has deposed on similar terms in regard to the second accused asking the deceased to sleep with her after being drunk and allegation regarding chipri  flat numbere . He, however, in cross examination says that he had told the Officer about less dowry being given and about the demand of television and VCR. He says further that if it is number written, he cannot tell the reason. Similar is the position with regard to harassment by the first accused. PW-6 is Patwari. He has referred to the various steps taken by him in the investigation. He states in cross-examination that numbercomplaint was received by him from the side of the family of the deceased. PW-7 is Kanungo. He states that he took the statements of the witnesses PWs 1, 2 and 5. Between 05.06.1991 to 08.06.1991 numberody from the side had companye and told him about the facts of harassment of deceased, demand of dowry and attempt to companymit rape by the second accused. No evidence was given against the first accused before 19.06.1991. he says as follows I have taken the statement of Km.

This has been marked as Exh. Kha-8. The statement which was got marked in regard to PW1 reads as follows Deceased had never companyplained about her husband first accused and she was happy always with him and the first accused also held her good. In regard to the statement proved in regard to Laxmi-PW2/mother of the deceased, the actual statement is she  apparently the deceased  had never companyplained about him regarding harassment or beating or any fact about giving less dowry.  Emphasis supplied  The further statement which is proved through PW7- Kanungo and attributed to PW2, reads as follows I have numbersuspicion about the killing or getting killed the deceased or any harassment by him.  Emphasis supplied  PW-5, the uncle of the deceased is proved to have made the statement The husband of the deceased Girish Singh is at his residence since one month and I have numberknowledge about any harassment of deceased.

Yours father Sd - Address G.S. Bisht State Bank of Hyderabad V.

Yours younger brother Sd - illegible It is relevant to remember that the father of the deceased has admitted that the letters were written dated 28.02.1991 and 20.03.1991 in reply to letters written by the deceased. The letters do number disclose about any harassment or cruelty or the dowry demand. In his deposition, PW4-father of the deceased would say that he is unable to say why any fact of dowry harassment has number been written in these letters. The letters written by the deceased have been misplaced according to PW4-father of the deceased. The significance of the letters, admittedly written by PW4 to her deceased daughter and the absence of any companyplaint about dowry harassment, lies in the following categoric statement made by PW4-father of deceased, as follows Accused behaved numbermally with the deceased for five months and thereafter, they started misbehaving. My daughter companyld read and write a little and she had written two letters to me in this regard.  Emphasis supplied  The aforesaid letters written by the deceased are number made available on the ground that they had been misplaced. Certainly, if these letters, which are admittedly written by PW4-father of the deceased are in response to the letters written by his deceased daughter, the companytents of letters written by the father do number bear out the case of companyduct by the accused as is sought to be made out. We have referred to the entire evidence. The Trial Court acquitted the accused. The jurisdiction of the Appellate Court, when it deals with such an order, is numberlonger res integra and is subject matter of catena of decisions of this Court. In Upendra Pradhan v. State of Orissa1, this Court took the view that if there is benefit of doubt, it must go to the accused, and in case of two views, the view that favours the accused, should be taken, which was more so where the Trial Courts decision was number manifestly illegal, perverse and did number cause miscarriage of justice. In Dilawar Singh and others v. State of Haryana2, this Court took the view that companyrt will number interfere with the verdict of acquittal merely because on evaluation of evidence, a different plausible view may arise. Very substantial and companypelling reasons must exist with the Appellate Court to interfere with an acquittal. In Gamini Bala Koteswara Rao and others v. State of Andhra Pradesh Through Secretary3, this Court accepted the companytention of the appellant that interference in an appeal against acquittal should be rare and in 1  2015  11 SCC 124 2  2015  1 SCC 737 3 AIR 2010 SC 589 exceptional circumstance. It was further held that it is open to the High Court to reappraise the evidence and companyclusions arrived at by the Trial Court. However, it is limited to those cases where the judgment of Trial Court was perverse. This Court went on to declare that the word perverse, as understood in law, has been understood to mean, against the weight of evidence. If there are two views and the Trial Court has taken one of the views merely because another view is plausible, the Appellate Court will number be justified in interfering with the verdict of acquittal  See K. Prakashan v. P.K. Surenderan4 . Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code reads as follows 304B. Dowry death.  1  Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under numbermal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in 4  2008  1 SCC 258 companynection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called dowry death, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death. Explanation. For the purpose of this sub- section, dowry shall have the same meaning as in section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961  28 of 1961 . Whoever companymits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall number be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life. Section 113B of The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 reads as follows 113B. Presumption as to dowry death. When the question is whether a person has companymitted the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman has been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in companynection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death. Explanation.For the purposes of this section, dowry death shall have the same meaning as in section 304B, of the Indian Penal Code,  45 of 1860 . Thus, it can be seen that the offence created by Section 304B requires the following elements to be present in order that it may apply Within 7 years of the marriage, there must happen the death of a woman  the wife . II. The death must be caused by any burns or bodily injury. OR The death must occur otherwise than under numbermal circumstances. III. It must be established that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment. IV. The cruelty or harassment may be by her husband or any relative of her husband. The cruelty or harassment by the husband or relative of the husband must be for, or in companynection with, any demand for dowry. Section 304B treats this as a dowry death. Therefore, in such circumstances, it further provides that husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death. Section 113B of The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provides for presumption as to dowry death. It provides that when the question is whether the dowry death, namely, the death companytemplated under Section 304B of the IPC, has been companymitted by a person, if it is shown that soon before her death, the woman was subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment, for in companynection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death. It is numberdoubt a rebuttable presumption and it is open to the husband and his relatives to show the absence of the elements of Section 304B. The foremost aspect to be established by the prosecution is that there was reliable evidence to show that the woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his relatives which must be for or in companynection with any demand for dowry, soon before her death. Before the presumption is raised, it must be established that the woman was subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment and it is number any cruelty that becomes the subject matter of the provision but it is the cruelty or harassment for or in companynection with, demand for dowry. Admittedly, the deceased was influenced by spirit  devta . Religious ceremony prayers were held. The deceased became numbermal after doing it. Still further, there is evidence that whatever madness the deceased used to do, it was taken care of by her in-laws house. The above facts emerge from the testimony of PW1-sister of the deceased herself. It is relevant to remember that it is a case of suicide. In the statement under Section 313 of the Code, the 1st accused in fact states as follows The deceased was under influence of evil spirit. We companyducted prayers two times but she companyld number be cured. Her mind was restless and she companymitted suicide and her family falsely implicated us. PW4-father of the deceased companypletely companytradicts himself, when in cross-examination, he states that 5-6 days after marriage, the first accused and the deceased came, he was on duty. There is evidence when PW4 was working in Bombay  See the evidence of PW2/wife of PW4, who has deposed that her husband was working in Bombay . Earlier in cross-examination, PW4 has deposed that when he was going back after 5-6 days of marriage, the first accused came to take the deceased and then the first accused has said that television and VCR has number been given. PW4 says in chief examination that he had told the first accused that he has given according to his ability and if everything goes fine, it will also be done. PW4 further stated that on this, the first accused said that deceased was having flat numbere. Thereafter, he states that he went back to Bombay on his duty. We numbericed that this aspect has number been companysidered at all by the High Court. This companytradiction in evidence goes to the root of the matter. This proves that the prosecution case sought to be proved through PW4, is unacceptable. PW2 would say that the deceased was an illiterate. She did number know how to read and write. On the other hand, PW4 would depose that the deceased companyld read and write letters. In fact, PW2 herself stated that her husband-PW4 reached home after hearing about the death of the deceased and told PW2 that he has received two letters of the deceased regarding harassment by the accused about dowry and one letter of Jodh Singh-the second accused. It is here that two letters which have been written admittedly by PW4-father of the deceased, assumes critical significance. PW2-wife of the PW4, as we have numbericed, has deposed that PW4 has told her that he received two letters from the deceased where there is reference to harassment about dowry by the accused. PW4, when questioned about the letters, admits having sent the letters by way of reply to such letters written by the deceased. We have already extracted the letters. It is amply clear that there is numberreference about any harassment or cruelty on account of dowry in those letters. PW4, in fact, deposes that he cannot tell the reason that why any fact of dowry harassment has number been written in those letters. He admits that those letters were written in reply to the letters written by the deceased. Significantly, the two letters written by the deceased are number produced by the prosecution. The reason for number-production is, they were misplaced during shifting of the house. Even, accepting that those letters were misplaced, the question whether they companytained allegation of harassment due to dowry, should have been resolved with reference to the letters admittedly sent by PW4 to the deceased within a few days of the receipt of the letters. In other words, a reasonable view would be that as reference to any harassment regarding dowry is companyspicuous by its absence in the letters written by the PW4 to the deceased. There were numberallegations of harassment on account of dowry in the letters written by the deceased to her father-PW4. In this regard, the High Court, in the impugned judgment, has proceeded to ignore this vital aspect and proceeded on the basis that the averments made by the deceased of the cruelty caused by the appellants were mentioned in the letters sent by the deceased and letters written by PW4, are number helpful to resolve this issue. The last of the two letters written by PW4-father of the accused is dated 20.03.1991. The death took place on 05.06.1991. Even, in the letter written by PW4, letter dated 28.05.1991, in an envelope addressed to his son, there is numbermention about any harassment or cruelty on account of dowry demand. He only says to ask the deceased number to worry and number to send her even if anybody companyes to call her. The High Court, however, still takes the view that dowry related harassment was mentioned in letters sent by the deceased which are number even produced. We are of the view that this approach, particularly, in an appeal against acquittal is clearly unacceptable and cannot be approved. Still further, through the Officer, statements actually made by the prosecution witnesses, have been proved. PW1-sister of the deceased, in her statement, stated as follows The deceased had never companyplained about the first accused and she was happy always with him and brother-in-law also held her good. This statement made by her to the Officer was also put to her. She merely says that she does number know how this fact was written in her statement. She says she has number given such a statement. She is unable to give the reason. The High Court, in regard to the said statement, gets over previous statement proved though Officer by stating that the statement was number given by the witness and that she was a girl of 13 years and further stated that her deposition in companyrt inspires companyfidence. Likewise, PW2-mother of the deceased, has given her statement that deceased has never companyplained about him regarding harassment or beatings or fact of giving less dowry. Still further, she is also proved to have given the statement that she had numbersuspicion of killing or getting killed by the accused or any harassment by him. Similar findings are rendered by the High Court in regard to the said statements. We would think that particularly in an appeal from acquittal, the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in the appreciation of evidence as well as its approach to how the reliability of the witness is to be evaluated. We are troubled with another aspect highlighted by the facts of this case. A right of appeal is the creature of statue. Unless appellate power is expressly limited by additional companyditionalities, the Appellate Court has power or rather is duty bound in the case of an appeal by the accused to reappraise the evidence. Even in an appeal against acquittal, the appellate companyrt has power of reappraisal of evidence though subject to the limitation that interference would be in a case where the Trial Courts verdict is against the weight of evidence which is the same thing as a perverse verdict. We need number catalogue the circumstances which are well-settled. In this case, we numberice that the High Court has referred to the companytents of the chief examination of the witnesses. Thereafter, it has been stated that the witnesses have been cross-examined at length but numberhing has companye out in evidence which would create any doubt in his evidence. The witnesses are declared as being found reliable and believable. We have numbered the facts in this case. Truth in a criminal trial is discovered by number merely going through the cross-examination of the witnesses. There must be an analysis of the chief examination of the witnesses in companyjunction with the cross examination and the re-examination, if any. The effect of what other witnesses have deposed must also enter into companysideration of the matter. On the one hand, the laudable object underlying Section 304B of the IPC is number to be lost sight of. On the other hand, it is equally important that the Appellate Court must number be oblivious to the fact what it is duty bound to find is whether an offence is companymitted or number and such a pursuit also would embrace the duty of the companyrt to apply its mind to the evidence as a whole and arrive at companyclusions as to facts and inferences therefrom as well. After all, at stake for the accused are, priceless rights to liberty, reputation and the right to life, number only of himself but also his family members. The Law Giver, has companytemplated that the High Court will be the final arbiter of facts and even of law. The jurisdiction of the Apex Court was deliberately limited to the extra ordinary powers it enjoys under Article 136 of the Constitution of India unless it be exercised under other provisions. What we wish to emphasise is that the cause of justice and the interest of litigants would be better subserved if the Appellate Court takes a closer look, in particular of the cross-examination of the witnesses and analyse the same. There is yet another important aspect in this matter. It is true that the deceased died on 05.06.1991 which was within seven years of marriage. It is equally true that her death was due to burning and she companymitted suicide. It is number a case where the accused stood charged under any provision except Section 304B read with Section 34 of the IPC and Section 306 read with Section 34 of the IPC. The case of abetting suicide under Section 306 read with Section 34 of the IPC has been found unacceptable both by the Trial companyrt and the High Court and the appellants stand acquitted. A perusal of the impugned judgment of the High Court would show, that accepting the version of the prosecution witnesses, the High Court has been persuaded to hold inter alia that the second accused also harassed her by asking her to provide liquor in the glass, and after taking liquor, in the state of intoxication, he used to ask her to sleep with him. On her refusal, it was found that she was subjected to mental cruelty. Reference was made to evidence of PW4- father of the deceased that after he came back from Mumbai, he came to know that the second accused was taking liquor and trying to companymit rape and also used to harass her for television and VCR due to which she companymitted suicide. The High Court was in clear error in taking into companysideration the evidence relating to harassment by the second accused on the basis that he, in the state of intoxication, asked her to sleep with him, and on that basis, she was subjected to mental cruelty. The said evidence is totally irrelevant and foreign to the scope of a trial for the offence under Section 304B of the IPC. It does number relate, at all, to the demand for dowry.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n"," Appellant is before us aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order dated 12.10.2004 passed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad, whereby and whereunder the appeal preferred by him from a judgment and order dated 21.12.2001 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Khammam in S.C. No.143/2001 companyvicting the appellant herein for companymission of an offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Rs. 100, in default to suffer I. for one month, was dismissed. The basic fact of the matter is number in dispute. The deceased Batta Chandramma is the mother-in-law of the appellant. Appellant married her third daughter Bhadrakali sometime in 1990. A daughter and a son were born to them. As appellant is said to have started harassing his wife by beating and abusing her, she deserted him and went to her parents house at Chinthalagudem Village and started living with them. Appellant, thereafter, married another woman. However, he came to Village Chinthalagudem where his parents-in-law were residing, to live with them. But after 10 days he started harassing his wife again. Batta Chandramma  the deceased  - mother-in-law of the appellant allegedly used to quarrel with him and had asked him to leave the house. On 19.10.1999, the deceased went to the agricultural field belonging to the family and she did number return till evening. On enquiry, one B.P. Veraiah informed the informant that he had seen the appellant in the fields and also heard some cries. Pursuant thereto, Pitchaiah, Chinna Veeraiah, Barla Ram Babu and Degala Veeraiah went to the fields in search of Chandramma. They found her dead body lying in a pool of blood. Her sari was also tied around her neck. Accusing the appellant as the person responsible for her death, a first information report was lodged. Appellant was arrested at about 8.30 P.M. on 22.10.1999. He admitted his guilt and companyfessed about the companymission of the offence. He also made a disclosure statement pursuant whereto a stick and a stone, which were said to have been used in the companymission of the offence, were recovered. The said articles were seized. Appellant was produced before Shri R. Verra Reddy, Mandal Magistrate, Dummugudem on 4.11.1999 and his companyfessional statement was recorded. Before the learned Sessions Judge, the prosecution examined 18 witnesses. We, however, need number deal with the depositions of all the prosecution witnesses. Suffice it to point out that PW-1  Batta Pitchaiah  - father-in-law of the appellant in his deposition categorically supported the statements made in the first information report before the S.H.O. of Bhadrachalam Police Station. PW-2 Bhadrakali, who is the wife of the appellant, also supported the prosecution case. PW-3 Batta Pedda Veeraiah and PW-4 Batta China Veeraiah, who were brothers of PW-1 and had been working in the adjoining fields, deposed that they had seen appellant and the deceased together. PW-3 categorically stated that whereas the deceased Chandramma was sitting on Mancha in her paddy field, the appellant  accused  was standing near it and Chandramma was shouting at appellant. Thinking that the same was a companymon affair between them, he went to his work. The evidence of PW- 4 is also to the same effect. PW-5 Degala Veeraiah is a resident of Chinthalagudem Village. He in his deposition categorically stated that on the date of incident, while he was grazing his bulls at the pastures at about 1.00 P.M., he found the appellant going towards the field of PW-1. He furthermore found the appellant companying back in a hurry at about 4.00 P.M He called him  appellant  but he did number give any reply to his call and went away. On the same night he learnt that Chandramma was found dead in the fields. PW-6 Barla Raghavulu who is also a resident of Chinthalagudem Village, a mason by occupation, in his evidence stated that 3 days after the death of Chandramma, he saw the accused while he was talking to his brother at Bhupathiraopeta Colony. When the accused was questioned, he companyfessed before him that he killed his mother-in-law as she had number been allowing him to live with his wife  PW-2 . Appellant was caught by the said witness and then handed over to the S.H.O., Bhadrachalam Police Station. PW-7 K. Rajamma is said to be the second wife of the appellant. She came to learn about the first marriage of the appellant one year after her marriage with him. Thereafter, she left his companypany. According to her also, appellant used to beat her after companysuming alcohol. One D. Motiya, who examined himself as PW-8, was residing in the house adjacent to the house of the deceased. He also testified that the appellant used to harass his wife PW-2 whereupon a Panchayat meeting was companyvened and the appellant was chastised. He also deposed that after the meeting of the Panchayat, appellant came to his in-laws place and started living there. He also proved that Chandramma used to harass and warn him to go out of the said house but he companytinued to live there. Almost to the same effect is the evidence of PW-9. Both PW- 8 PW-9 supported the prosecution case. The learned Sessions Judge having regard to the aforementioned materials brought on record by the prosecution found the appellant guilty of companymission of offence and recorded a judgment of companyviction and sentence in the manner as numbericed hereinbefore. The High Court on appeal preferred by appellant has affirmed the said judgment of companyviction and sentence. Mr. Ansar Ahmad Chaudhary, learned companynsel appearing on behalf of appellant would raise the following companytentions in support of this appeal That the recovery of stone having been made from an open place, numberreliance companyld have been placed thereupon by the Courts below. The evidence of PW Nos.3, 4, 5 6 companyld number have been relied upon by the Courts below as it was wholly unbelievable that although they had been working in the adjoining fields, but did number companye to the rescue of the deceased despite her cries. PW-1 - the informant in the first information report did number make any statement as to how the death of the deceased took place and as such prosecution must be held to have failed to prove its case. No reliance can be placed on the statement of the appellant purported to have been made under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as numberrequisite warning, before making the statement, that the same can be used against him in the criminal case was given. Learned companynsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, supported the impugned judgment. The background fact in which the offence was alleged to have been companymitted is number in dispute. The relationship between the parties is also number in dispute. The fact that appellant had married PW-2 and they had been living separately for a few years before he came to his parents-in-laws house to live with his wife has also number been disputed. Out of those witnesses who had deposed in support of the prosecution case for proving the guilt of appellant, number only PW-5, but also the second wife of the appellant who are independent witnesses, to a large extent, supported the prosecution case. The strained relationship between appellant and the deceased must be held to have been proved. PW-2 who is the wife of the appellant, had companypletely supported the prosecution case in that regard. The prosecution case must also be companysidered from another angle. PW-6, although is a resident of Chinthalagudem Village, who had been earning his livelihood by working as a mason, used to visit Bhadrachalam. He found the appellant talking with his brother at Bhupathiraopeta Colony at about 7.30 P.M. on 22.10.1999. Appellant made an extra judicial companyfession before him. The reason that the deceased did number allow him to live with his wife  PW-2  was said to be the reason for companymission of the offence. It was at that point of time he caught hold of appellant and handed him over to the S.H.O. of the Bhadrachalam Police Station. Yet again in the Police Station, the appellant made a companyfession. Apart from the Investigating Officer  PW-18 , a companyfession was also made before PW-14 Yalam Kondal Rao, a resident of Bhadrachalam. Appellant did number raise any companytention that he did number make any extra judicial companyfession or a companyfession before the Judicial Officer as also before the PW- Indisputably, he was produced before the Mandal Officer. The investigation of the case was taken up by PW-18 Devadas. He produced the appellant before the Mandal Magistrate R. Veera Reddy on 4.11.1999. His statement was recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Submission of the learned companynsel for the appellant Mr. Ansar Ahmad Chowdhary that PW-15 Veera Reddy did number companyply with the provisions companytained in Section 164 Cr.P.C. may number be of much significance. Bhadrachalam falls within a scheduled area in the State of A.P. The State of A.P., this Court can take judicial numberice, had number extended the provisions of the new Cr.P.C. to the scheduled areas of the State of A.P. This fact would be evident from the fact that appellant was examined in terms of Section 342 of old Cr.P.C. As there is numberseparation of the Judicial and Executive Officers, appellant was produced before the Executive Officer for recording his statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. As the provisions of the old Code were applicable, the precautions which were required to be taken in terms of Section 164 of the 1973 Code were number companyplied with. Be that as it may, appellant never retracted the said companyfession. A statement made by the accused under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. is admissible in evidence. Apart from the judicial companyfession, as numbericed hereinbefore, the appellant has also made extra judicial companyfession before PW-6. PW-17 Dr. Jhansi Lakshmi, Civil Assistant Surgeon, Area Hospital, Bhadrachalam, who companyducted the post-mortem over the dead body of Chandramma, found the following ante-mortem injuries Lacerated wound 3 x 2 x 2 cms. over the forehead. Loss of right eye-ball. Lacerated would 3 x 4 x 1 cms. over dorsal aspect of left foot. Lacerated would 3 x 1 x 1 cms. over left side of abdomen. Abrasion 3 x 2 cms. over right elbow region. Contusion 5 x 6 cms. on right temporal region. Contusion 3 x 3 cms. over right cheek. The said Dr. Jhansi Lakshmi was examined as PW-17. In her deposition before the learned Sessions Judge, she categorically stated that those ante-mortem injuries were possible to have been caused by a blunt object like stone or stick. She found a fracture of ribs on the right side of the deceased, as a result of which a laceration of the right lung was found to be present. She also found 300 CC fluids blood in the right plural cavity, ligature mark on the neck of the deceased, companygestion and haemorrhage by the side of the ligature mark and sub-dural haemotoma on right temporal region. In the aforementioned background, PW-1 had number been able to specifically state the cause of death and he must be held to be a truthful witness. The exact cause of the death of the deceased, thus, in the aforementioned situation companyld number have been certain to a layman, like PW-1 and other witnesses. It may be true that the stone was found in an open place. But unless and until the site thereof was pointed out, as the Investigating Officer  PW-18  categorically stated, he companyld number have identified the weapon which was used for companymission of the offence. It was found to be blood stained. Apart from the stone, a stick was also pointed out by the appellant which led to its discovery. It is, therefore, number a case where the Courts below companyld have totally ignored recovery of the said articles. Furthermore, although number strictly admissible, even a companyfession was made by appellant in the Police Station before PW-14 and one Seetha Ramulu. Their statements before the Court are also number number in dispute. Submission of the learned companynsel for appellant that the last seen theory propounded by the prosecution cannot be relied upon, is, in our opinion, number of much substance. It has number been denied or disputed that the brothers of PW-1, namely, Batta Pedda Veeraiah  PW-3  and Batta China Veeraiah  PW-4  had lands by the side of the land of the deceased and PW-1. PW-3 in his statement, categorically stated that although appellant and the deceased were found to be quarrelling with each other, he ignored the same as that had become almost a routine affair. He came to know about number-return of the deceased from the field only in the evening.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n"," Dalveer Bhandari, J. Leave granted. This appeal has been filed by Preeti Gupta the married sister-in-law and a permanent resident of Navasari, Surat, Gujarat with her husband and Gaurav Poddar, a permanent resident of Goregaon, Maharashtra, who is the unmarried brother-in-law of the companyplainant, Manisha Poddar, against the impugned judgment of the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi, Jharkhand dated 27.4.2009 passed in Criminal Miscellaneous Petition Nos.304 of 2009. Brief facts which are necessary to dispose of this appeal are recapitulated as under The Complainant Manisha was married to Kamal Poddar at Kanpur on 10.12.2006. Immediately after the marriage, the companyplainant who is respondent number2 in this appeal left for Mumbai along with her husband Kamal Poddar who was working with the Tata Consultancy Services  for short TCS  and was permanently residing at Mumbai. The companyplainant also joined the TCS at Mumbai on 23.12.2006. Respondent number2 visited Ranchi to participate in Gangaur festival  an important Hindu festival widely celebrated in Northern India  on 16.3.2007. After staying there for a week, she returned to Mumbai on 24.03.2007. Respondent number2, Manisha Poddar filed a companyplaint on 08.07.2007 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi under sections 498-A, 406, 341, 323 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code read with sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act against all immediate relations of her husband, namely, Pyarelal Poddar  father-in-law , Kamal Poddar  husband , Sushila Devi  mother-in-law , Gaurav Poddar  unmarried brother-in-law  and Preeti Gupta Preeti Agrawal  married sister-in-law . The companyplaint was transferred to the companyrt of the Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi. Statements of Respondent number2 and other witnesses were recorded and on 10.10.2008 the Judicial Magistrate took companynizance and passed the summoning order of the appellants. The appellants are aggrieved by the said summoning order. In the criminal companyplaint, it was alleged that a luxury car was demanded by all the accused named in the companyplaint. It was also alleged that respondent number2 was physically assaulted at Mumbai. According to the said allegations of the companyplainant, it appears that the alleged incidents had taken place either at Kanpur or Mumbai. According to the averments of the companyplaint, except for the demand of the luxury car numberincident of harassment took place at Ranchi. According to the appellants, there was numberspecific allegation against both the appellants in the companyplaint. Appellant number1 had been permanently residing with her husband at Navasari, Surat  Gujarat  for the last more than seven years. She had never visited Mumbai during the year 2007 and never stayed with respondent number2 or her husband. Similarly, appellant number2, unmarried brother-in-law of the companyplainant has also been permanently residing at Goregaon, Maharashtra. It was asserted that there is numberspecific allegation in the entire companyplaint against both the appellants. The statements of prosecution witnesses PW1 to PW4 were also recorded along with the statement of the companyplainant. None of the prosecution witnesses had stated anything against the appellants. These appellants had very clearly stated in this appeal that they had never visited Ranchi. The appellants also stated that they had never interfered with the internal affairs of the companyplainant and her husband. According to them, there was numberquestion of any interference because the appellants had been living in different cities for a number of years. It was clearly alleged by the appellants that they had been falsely implicated in this case. It was further stated that the companyplaint against the appellants was totally without any basis or foundation. The appellants also asserted that even if all the allegations incorporated in the companyplaint were taken to be true, even then numberoffence companyld be made out against them. The appellants had submitted that the High Court ought to have quashed this companyplaint as far as both the appellants are companycerned because there were numberspecific allegations against the appellants and they ought number have been summoned. In the impugned judgment, while declining to exercise its inherent powers, the High Court observed as under In this companytext, I may again reiterate that the acts relating to demand or subjecting to cruelty, as per the companyplaint petition, have been companymitted at the place where the companyplainant was living with her husband. However, the companyplainant in her statement made under solemn affirmation has stated that when she came to Ranchi on the occasion of Holi, all the accused persons came and passed sarcastic remarks which in absence of actual wordings, according to the learned companynsel appearing for the petitioner companyld never be presumed to be an act companystituting offence under section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. In this appeal, both the appellants specifically asserted that they had never visited Ranchi, therefore, the allegations that they made any sarcastic remarks to the companyplainant had numberbasis or foundation as far as the appellants are companycerned. The companyplainant companyld number dispute that appellant number1 was a permanent resident living with her husband at Navasari, Surat, Gujarat for the last more than seven years and the appellant number2 was permanent resident of Goregaon, Maharashtra. They had never spent any time with respondent number2. According to the appellants, they are number the residents of Ranchi and if they are companypelled to attend the Ranchi Court repeatedly then that would lead to insurmountable harassment and inconvenience to the appellants as well as to the companyplainant. The companyplaint in this case under section 498-A IPC has led to several other cases. It is mentioned that a divorce petition has been filed by the husband of respondent number2. Both respondent number2 and her husband are highly qualified and are working with reputed organization like Tata Consultancy Service. If because of temperamental incompatibility they cannot live with each other then it is proper that they should jointly get a decree of divorce by mutual companysent. Both respondent number2 and her husband are in such age group that if proper efforts are made, their re- settlement may number be impossible. The main question which falls for companysideration in this case is whether the High Court was justified in number exercising its inherent powers under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the facts and circumstances of this case? This companyrt in a number of cases has laid down the scope and ambit of companyrts powers under section 482 Cr.P.C. Every High Court has inherent power to act ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice, for the administration of which alone it exists, or to prevent abuse of the process of the companyrt. Inherent power under section 482 Cr.P.C. can be exercised to give effect to an order under the Code to prevent abuse of the process of companyrt, and to otherwise secure the ends of justice. Reference to the following cases would reveal that the companyrts have companysistently taken the view that they must use this extraordinary power to prevent injustice and secure the ends of justice. The English companyrts have also used inherent power to achieve the same objective. It is generally agreed that the Crown Court has inherent power to protect its process from abuse. In Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions 1964 AC 1254, Lord Devlin stated that where particular criminal proceedings companystitute an abuse of process, the companyrt is empowered to refuse to allow the indictment to proceed to trial. Lord Salmon in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys 1977 AC 1 stressed the importance of the inherent power when he observed that it is only if the prosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of the companyrt and is oppressive and vexatious that the judge has the power to intervene. He further mentioned that the companyrts power to prevent such abuse is of great companystitutional importance and should be jealously preserved. The powers possessed by the High Court under section 482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the power requires great caution in its exercise. The companyrt must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles. The inherent power should number be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution but companyrts failing to use the power for advancement of justice can also lead to grave injustice. The High Court should numbermally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case where all the facts are incomplete and hazy more so, when the evidence has number been companylected and produced before the companyrt and the issues involved, whether factual or legal, are of such magnitude that they cannot be seen in their true perspective without sufficient material. Of companyrse, numberhard and fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in which the High Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the proceedings at any stage. This companyrt had occasion to examine the legal position in a large number of cases. In R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab AIR 1960 SC 866, this companyrt summarized some categories of cases where inherent power can and should be exercised to quash the proceedings where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or companytinuance of the proceedings where the allegations in the first information report or companyplaint taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do number companystitute the offence alleged where the allegations companystitute an offence, but there is numberlegal evidence adduced or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge. This companyrt in State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy Others  1977  2 SCC 699 observed that the wholesome power under section 482 Cr.P.C. entitles the High Court to quash a proceeding when it companyes to the companyclusion that allowing the proceeding to companytinue would be an abuse of the process of the companyrt or that the ends of justice require that the proceeding ought to be quashed. The High Courts have been invested with inherent powers, both in civil and criminal matters, to achieve a salutary public purpose. A companyrt proceeding ought number to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of harassment or persecution. In this case, the companyrt observed that ends of justice are higher than the ends of mere law though justice must be administered according to laws made by the legislature. This case has been followed in a large number of subsequent cases of this companyrt and other companyrts. In Madhu Limaye v. The State of Maharashtra  1977  4 SCC 551, a three-Judge Bench of this companyrt held as under- In case the impugned order clearly brings out a situation which is an abuse of the process of the companyrt, or for the purpose of securing the ends of justice interference by the High Court is absolutely necessary, then numberhing companytained in Section 397 2  can limit or affect the exercise of the inherent power by the High Court. Such cases would necessarily be few and far between. One such case would be the desirability of the quashing of a criminal proceeding initiated illegally, vexatiously or as being without jurisdiction. The present case would undoubtedly fall for exercise of the power of the High Court in accordance with Section 482 of the 1973 Code, even assuming, that the invoking of the revisional power of the High Court is impermissible. This companyrt in Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia Others Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre Others  1988  1 SCC 692 observed in para 7 as under The legal position is well settled that when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the companyrt is as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the offence. It is also for the companyrt to take into companysideration any special features which appear in a particular case to companysider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to companytinue. This is so on the basis that the companyrt cannot be utilized for any oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the companyrt chances of an ultimate companyviction is bleak and, therefore, numberuseful purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to companytinue, the companyrt may while taking into companysideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceeding even though it may be at a preliminary stage. In State of Haryana Others v. Bhajan Lal Others 1992 Supp.  1  SCC 335, this companyrt in the backdrop of interpretation of various relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure  for short, Cr.P.C.  under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this companyrt in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or the inherent powers under section 482 Cr.P.C. gave the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power companyld be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of the companyrt or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. Thus, this companyrt made it clear that it may number be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list to myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised Where the allegations made in the first information report or the companyplaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do number prima facie companystitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do number disclose a companynizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156 1  of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155 2  of the Code. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or companyplaint and the evidence companylected in support of the same do number disclose the companymission of any offence and make out a case against the accused. Where, the allegations in the FIR do number companystitute a companynizable offence but companystitute only a number-cognizable offence, numberinvestigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as companytemplated under Section 155 2  of the Code. Where the allegations made in the FIR or companyplaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which numberprudent person can ever reach a just companyclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the companycerned Act  under which a criminal proceeding is instituted  to the institution and companytinuance of the proceedings and or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the companycerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge. In G. Sagar Suri Another v. State of UP Others  2000  2 SCC 636, this companyrt observed that it is the duty and obligation of the criminal companyrt to exercise a great deal of caution in issuing the process particularly when matters are essentially of civil nature. This companyrt in Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. Others v. Mohd. Sharaful Haque Another  2005  1 SCC 122 observed thus- It would be an abuse of process of the companyrt to allow any action which would result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of the powers, companyrt would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation companytinuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of companyrt or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice. When numberoffence is disclosed by the companyplaint, the companyrt may examine the question of fact. When a companyplaint is sought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the companyplainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if the allegations are accepted in toto. A three-Judge Bench  of which one of us, Bhandari, J. was the author of the judgment  of this Court in Inder Mohan Goswami and Another v. State of Uttaranchal Others  2007  12 SCC 1 companyprehensively examined the legal position. The companyrt came to a definite companyclusion and the relevant observations of the companyrt are reproduced in para 24 of the said judgment as under- Inherent powers under section 482 Cr.P.C. though wide have to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with great caution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid down in this section itself. Authority of the companyrt exists for the advancement of justice. If any abuse of the process leading to injustice is brought to the numberice of the companyrt, then the Court would be justified in preventing injustice by invoking inherent powers in absence of specific provisions in the Statute. We have very carefully companysidered the averments of the companyplaint and the statements of all the witnesses recorded at the time of the filing of the companyplaint. There are numberspecific allegations against the appellants in the companyplaint and numbere of the witnesses have alleged any role of both the appellants. Admittedly, appellant number1 is a permanent resident of Navasari, Surat, Gujarat and has been living with her husband for more than seven years. Similarly, appellant number2 is a permanent resident of Goregaon, Maharasthra. They have never visited the place where the alleged incident had taken place. They had never lived with respondent number2 and her husband. Their implication in the companyplaint is meant to harass and humiliate the husbands relatives. This seems to be the only basis to file this companyplaint against the appellants. Permitting the companyplainant to pursue this companyplaint would be an abuse of the process of law. It is a matter of companymon knowledge that unfortunately matrimonial litigation is rapidly increasing in our companyntry. All the companyrts in our companyntry including this companyrt are flooded with matrimonial cases. This clearly demonstrates discontent and unrest in the family life of a large number of people of the society. The companyrts are receiving a large number of cases emanating from section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code which reads as under- 498-A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.--Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, cruelty means-  a  any wilful companyduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to companymit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health  whether mental or physical  of the woman or  b  harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to companyrcing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand. It is a matter of companymon experience that most of these companyplaints under section 498-A IPC are filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues without proper deliberations. We companye across a large number of such companyplaints which are number even bona fide and are filed with oblique motive. At the same time, rapid increase in the number of genuine cases of dowry harassment are also a matter of serious companycern. The learned members of the Bar have enormous social responsibility and obligation to ensure that the social fiber of family life is number ruined or demolished. They must ensure that exaggerated versions of small incidents should number be reflected in the criminal companyplaints. Majority of the companyplaints are filed either on their advice or with their companycurrence. The learned members of the Bar who belong to a numberle profession must maintain its numberle traditions and should treat every companyplaint under section 498-A as a basic human problem and must make serious endeavour to help the parties in arriving at an amicable resolution of that human problem. They must discharge their duties to the best of their abilities to ensure that social fiber, peace and tranquility of the society remains intact. The members of the Bar should also ensure that one companyplaint should number lead to multiple cases. Unfortunately, at the time of filing of the companyplaint the implications and companysequences are number properly visualized by the companyplainant that such companyplaint can lead to insurmountable harassment, agony and pain to the companyplainant, accused and his close relations. The ultimate object of justice is to find out the truth and punish the guilty and protect the innocent. To find out the truth is a herculean task in majority of these companyplaints. The tendency of implicating husband and all his immediate relations is also number uncommon. At times, even after the companyclusion of criminal trial, it is difficult to ascertain the real truth. The companyrts have to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these companyplaints and must take pragmatic realities into companysideration while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment of husbands close relations who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited the place where the companyplainant resided would have an entirely different companyplexion. The allegations of the companyplaint are required to be scrutinized with great care and circumspection. Experience reveals that long and protracted criminal trials lead to rancour, acrimony and bitterness in the relationship amongst the parties. It is also a matter of companymon knowledge that in cases filed by the companyplainant if the husband or the husbands relations had to remain in jail even for a few days, it would ruin the chances of amicable settlement altogether. The process of suffering is extremely long and painful. Before parting with this case, we would like to observe that a serious relook of the entire provision is warranted by the legislation. It is also a matter of companymon knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large number of companyplaints. The tendency of over implication is also reflected in a very large number of cases. The criminal trials lead to immense sufferings for all companycerned. Even ultimate acquittal in the trial may also number be able to wipe out the deep scars of suffering of ignominy. Unfortunately a large number of these companyplaints have number only flooded the companyrts but also have led to enormous social unrest affecting peace, harmony and happiness of the society. It is high time that the legislature must take into companysideration the pragmatic realities and make suitable changes in the existing law. It is imperative for the legislature to take into companysideration the informed public opinion and the pragmatic realities in companysideration and make necessary changes in the relevant provisions of law. We direct the Registry to send a companyy of this judgment to the Law Commission and to the Union Law Secretary, Government of India who may place it before the Honble Minister for Law Justice to take appropriate steps in the larger interest of the society.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n","NANAVATI,J. This appeal, by the State of Maharashtra is Directed against the companymon judgment and order passed by the Bombay High Court, in Confirmation Case No. 4 of 1986 and Criminal Appeal No. 288 of 1986. The High Court reversed the Judgment of the Court of Sessions for Greater Bombay in Sessions Case No. 585 of 1984 companyvicting the respondent under section 498A IPC for subjecting his wife Vibha to cruelty and under section 302 IPC for causing her death. The respondent married Vibha on 29.5.1981. Vibha was the daughter of Chandrakant Shukla, an uneducated person, who started his life as a salesman, but eventually switched over to business and in due companyrse of time became an owner of 15 flour mills and 3 buildings. He had four daughters including Vibha. Vibha had studied upto first year B.Sc Vibhas family was staying at Jogeshwari. At the time of his marriage the respondent was staying with his father Chotelal who was then an Assistant Commissioner of police in Bombay. They were staying in a Government flat at Dadar. The respondent was then serving in local companycern. He had obtained some qualification in engineering from a foreign private institution. It was the prosecution case that the proposal had companye from the respondents side for the hand of Vibha an during further negotiations respondents father had demanded dowry of Rs. 1,50,000. Ultimately, Chandrakant had agreed to pay Rs. 1,00,000 as dowry inclusive of jewellery, utensils and clothes. After their marriage the respondent and Vibha had started staying in a flat at Mulund which belonged to the respondents father. Vibhas father chandrakant was required to pay money for utensils, gas companynection and other articles required for setting up respondents home at Mulund. It was also the prosecution case that on the very first visit by the parents of Vibha to the respondents fathers flat at Dadar, the respondents father had insulted Vibhas mother Pushpa. He companysidered it belows his dignity and status to talk to the parents of vibha as they were uneducated. The prosecution case further was that in September or October, 1981 the respondent decided to give up the job and set up a plastic factory of his own. He wanted Vibhas father to give money for that purpose. Vibhas father to be a guarantor and also obtained his signatures on some loan papers. The respondent, however, did number invite him on the opening day of the factory but, when he went on his own to the factory after about 10 days the respondents had told him that he needed more money to run his factory. thereupon he had paid Rs. 30,000 to the respondent. That was in November or December, 1981. Vibha was by that time pregnant so she went to her parents house at Jogeshwari in January, 1982 for delivery. she gave birth to a female child on 27.3.1982. She had to undergo a Caesarean operation. even though the respondent and his parents were informed about the operation and birth of the female child numbere of them visited the hospital at the time of the operation. even thereafter the parents of the respondent did number visit the hospital to inquire about the health of Vibha or to see the female child. None of them remained present on 7th April, 1982 the day on which her naming ceremony was performed. The female child was named Rachna. After about four or five days Rachna became ill and was admitted in a hospital for about 15 days. Only on the next day the respondent had gone to the hospital but his parents had number visited the hospital at all. In may, 1982 the respondent had visited Vibhas fathers house at jogeshwari and demanded rs. 5,000 as that amount was needed by him, vibhas father had paid that amount. On the same day vibha along with her daughter Rachna and sister Sushma had gone to Vibhas in laws house at Dadar. Vibha was allowed to stay but the respondent had told sushma to take Rachna back and when Sushma had shown her inability to take the child back the respondent had told her to place the child under tyres of a car. On vibhas request number to quarrel Sushma had gone back with the child who was brought up thereafter by the parents of Vibha. It was also the prosecution case that by this time at the instance of the respondent Vibha had withdrawn rs. 15,000 from her bank account and paid to the respondent. During one of his visits to Vibhas parents house the respondent had stated to them that he had numberlove and affection for Rachna or even for Vibha and that he was more interested in money. Right from September-October, 1981 the respondent and his parents were harassing her for money but she was tolerating the harassment with the hope of better days in future. On 26.11.1983 possibly because the situation became intolerable Vibha had telephoned her father that she was being harassed by the respondent and his parents and that he should companye and take her and back immediately. When Vibhas father had gone there she was found crying. When he had inquired about the reason, respondents father had replied that the respondent was in need of Rs. 30,000 and that he should pay that amount. When Vibhas father had told him to take his daughter back. He was thus forced to take Vibha back to his house at Jogeshwari. It was only because of the apology and assurance given by the respondent on the Next day, that he would treat her well that Vibhas parents had sent her back, even though she was number willing to go. Between 27.11.1983 and 22.6.1984 Vibha had visited her parents house on 3 or 4 occasions to see her child and on all those occasion she had companyplained about the harassment given to her for the sake of money. On 22.6.1984 she had sent a telephonic message to her parents that her mother should be sent with her daughter at Mulund on the next day as she was thereafter to go to Dadar and stay there for few days. Therefore, on 23.6.1984, Vibhas mother Pushpa  PW-8  and her sister Usha  PW -2  along with the child went in their jeep to Mulund. the driver and Rachna first went up in a lift. The respondent did number allow the driver to enter the flat. By the time Pushpa and Sushma reached the flat child Rachna had started crying so they told the driver to take her down. Sushma pressed the bell for about 10 minutes but the respondent did number open the door. They companyld hear the respondent uttering abusive words from inside the flat. When the respondent opened the door and they entered the flat they found that Vibha was burning in flames and was lying on the floor of the drawing room. The respondent was found number taking any initiative for extinguishing the fire. So Sushma pulled a curtain and extinguished the fire. Thereafter when Pushpa inquired as to what had happened Vibha had told her that Ashok Ne Mujhe Jala Diya   Ashok has burnt me . Pushpa then requested he respondent at least to call a doctor. Thereupon the respondent went down, sat in the jeep of Vibhas father, went to a hospital and got himself admitted there instead of sending a doctor for treatment of Vibha. One of the neighbours of the respondent called a doctor who gave some preliminary treatment to Vibha. One of the neighbours of the respondent called a doctor who gave some preliminary treatment to Vibha and took her to Sion Hospital. By that time Dr. Shah made arrangements for Getting her admitted Vibhas father had also arrived thee and when he inquired from Vibha as to what had happened she told him that she was burnt by Ashok. The police was informed, a case was registered and ultimately the respondent was chargesheeted and tried for companymitting the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 302 IPC. The defence of the accused was that because he had become fat and bulky and his face was disfigured because of an attack of small pox after the marriage and as the parents of Vibha believed that he had taken to smoking and drinking and was in a bad companypany, they thought that they had companymitted a mistake in getting their daughter married with him and therefore wanted her to take a divorce. That was the reason why the parents of Vibha were number sending Rachna to his house even though he w as willing to keep her. As regards the incident or 23.6.1984, his version was that while he was talking with Prakash Tambe  PW-9  and Maheshchandra Tiwari  PW-10  in the drawing room driver Vijay Gari Yadav  PW-11  came there with Rachna. As Rachna started crying he shouted for Vibha. At that time Vibha rushed into the drawing room in burning companydition. On seeing Vibha burning Tambe, Tiwari and Yadav ran out of the flat. At that moment Pushpa and Sushma entered the flat and started shouting Aag Laga Gaya. While extinguishing the fire with the help of a curtain he received burn injuries on his hands and face, so he went to a private hospital and got himself admitted there. He did number explain the other incriminating circumstances. In order to prove the charge of cruelty, prosecution had relied upon the following circumstances and incidents, as disclosed from the evidence of Chandrakant  PW-7 , Pushpa  PW-8 , Usha  PW-2 , Sushma  PW-12  and Mrs. Wagle  PW-13 - 1  insult of Vibhas parents by respondents father when they had gone to the house of respondents parents at Dadar, first time after the marriage of Vibha 2  attitude of the parents of the respondent at the time of delivery of Vibha 3  attitude of the parents of the respondent at the time of delivery of Vibha 4  attitude of the parents of the respondent while Rachna was required to be Hospitalised for a fortnight 5  number allowing rachna to remain in their house when vibha returned after delivery 6  numberlove and affection shown by the respondent ad his parents for rachna 7  incident of 26th November, 1983 when the respondent and his father told Vibhas father to take her back 8  demand of dowery and payments made by Vibhas father Chandrakant  PW-7  9  number giving utensils and other household articles to Vibha by the parents of the respondent when she and the respondent started staying at the Mulund flat and requiring the parents of Vibha to purchase such articles and 10  demands for money made by the respondent and his father for the business of the respondent. On the basis of first seven incidents circumstances it was companytended by the state that the respondent had by his wilful companyduct caused Cruelty to Vibha. The remaining three circumstances were relied upon in support of it s companytention that the respondent had harassed Vibha with a view to companyrce her and her father to meet the unlawful demands for money and or that the harassment was on account of failure by her and her father to meet such demands. The trial companyrt held the first incident as number proved. Circumstance number 2 was held as numbercircumstance against the respondent. As regards the third circumstance the trial companyrt, in absence of companysistent evidence as to how the invitation was extended to the parents of the respondent and in view of the fact that they were number personally invited but the invitation was extended only over telephone, held that their number attending the function, was number indicative of any intention to harass. The trial companyrt further held that in any case their indifference and improper attitude companyld number be regarded as a circumstance against the respondent. In absence of any evidence to show that the respondent himself was informed about the naming ceremony, the trial companyrt held that his remaining absent companyld number be regarded as a wilful companyduct intended to cause cruelty. Incidents circumstances at serial numbers five six and seven were held proved. Fifth circumstance was held sufficient to establish cruelty under section 498A IPC. Sixth circumstance was held an act of torture amounting to cruelty. Seventh circumstance was held an act of cruelty. the trial companyrt further held that merely because the respondent had apologised on the next day and assured good treatment to Vibha in future, the said act of cruelty did number get wiped out. Thus relying upon circumstances incidents at serial numbers 5, 6 and 7 the trial companyrt held that cruelty as explained by Explanation No. 1 of Section 498A was satisfactorily proved by the prosecution. Out of circumstances numbers 8,9 and 10 circumstance number 8 was held number proved. Circumstance number 9 was number companysidered as an unlawful demand amounting to cruelty. Only circumstance number 10 was held proved and the trial companyrt companysidered such demands as acts of harassment companytemplated by the second Explanation to section 498A IPC. In order to prove the charge of murder prosecution had relied upon- Motive, as disclose by the evidence of Chandrakant  PW- 7 , Pushpa  PW-8 , Usha  PW-2 , Sushma  PW-12  and Mrs. Wagle  PW-13  ii  evidence of Usha  PW-2  and Pushap  PW-8  as regards the events which took place on 23.6.1984 iii  evidence of hostile witnesses Prakash Tambe  PW-9 , Maheshchandra Tiwari  PW-10  and Vijay Hari Yadav  PW- 11  IV  The circumstances disclosed by the scene of offence- panchnama Immediate companyduct of the respondent and vi  Dying declarations and medical evidence. The trial companyrt believed that the respondent was in need of money for his business, that he was harassing Vibha with a view to companyrce her to get money from her father and that Vibhas father had shown his unwillingness to give more money to him. It, therefore, held that, after having lost hope of getting money from Vibhas father, the respondent had enough motive to kill her. The trial Court believed that the hostile witnesses Tambe  PW-9  and Tiwari  pw-10  had gone to the respondents flat on 23.6.1984 at about 2.15 M. but held that it was number possible to accept their version about the main incident as they were number telling the truth. It disbelieved their version that when driver Yadav  PW-11  came, they opened the door of the flat whereupon Yadav came inside and talked with the respondent, and that when Rachna started crying the respondent shouted Vibha- Vibha and at that time Vibha came into the drawing room in flames. After companysidering their evidence along with the evidence of driver Yadav  PW-11 , who had also turned hostile, the trial companyrt held that  i  driver Yadav had number entered the flat along with Rachna,  ii  Vibha had companye to the drawing room in burning companydition and thereafter Tambe and Tiwari had rushed out of the flat, and  iii  when tambe and Tiwari rushed out of the flat, driver Yadav , who had by that time reached the flat along with Rachna, had pressed the door bell, but the respondent closed the door and did number allow him to enter into the flat. The trial Court found the evidence of Usha  PW-2  and Pushpa  PW-8  as reliable and true and held that when they reached the 5th floor they saw tow persons hastily going down stairs, that they told driver Yadav to take rachna down stairs as she was crying that Usha pressed the door bell for about ten minutes, but the respondent did number open the door, that when he opened the door and they entered the flat they saw vibha burning and lying in the drawing room, that Usha  PW-2  pulled a curtain and tried to extinguish the fire and that Pushpa  PW-8  had to request the respondent to call a doctor. Considering their evidence together will the picture emerging from the scene of offence Panchnama the trial companyrt held as under- Considering the scene of offence it appears that Vibha was burnt number in the drawing room but major part of the burning has taken place in the passage between the drawing room and the bed room,. It is also in evidence of PW. 2 Mrs. usha that the oil can Court Article 4 was lying in drawing room and it is argued by the learned companynsel for the prosecution that it is impossible to believe that a burning lady would carry oil can in her hands carrying it from bedroom to drawing room. therefore, it can safely be inferred that 5 or 10 minutes after P.W. 9 and P.W 10 Tiwari left the flat Vibha was burning and ultimately she fell down burning in the drawing room on the carpet due to which partly carpet was burnt and at that stage the fire must have been at its fag end and at that time the door was opened and therefore, curtain was used to extinguish the fire with the result that a very small patch of the curtain is found burnt. If the fire was in such huge flames at the time when P.W 8 were to extinguish it, the whole curtain would have got burnt. That also pre-supposes that earlier to that numberattempt seems to have been made with the use of that curtain to extinguish the fire. Nothing can be said about the use of abusive words or shouts of Vibha witnesses it does appear that they had entered in the flat when Vibha was in the last stage of her burning. Because of which both these witnesses did number get any burn injuries The fact that sofa chair was also partly burnt companyrt Article 1 is proved and there is numberreason why we should disbelieve P.W. 2 Mrs. usha when she stated that accused received burn injuries on his own while extinguishing sofa chair. According to me the fire appeared to be so extensive companypled with the fact that Vibha appears to have burnt in the passage and as well as she had gone to the bath room and her saree was in pieces in the passage itself. If really any attempt was made to extinguish the fire the accused companyld have received extensive burn injuries. i, therefore, find that the evidence of P.W 2 Mrs. Usha and P.W 8 Mrs. Pushpa about the last fag end of the incident appears to be true and they companyld be believed to that extent. The trial companyrt also believed the evidence of Usha and Pushpa that the respondent had number made any attempt to extinguish the fire or helped Usha in doing so and had number shown any initiative to call a doctor. It also held on the basis of the other evidence on record that instead of sending a doctor for treatment of Vibha he went to Dr. Mukhis hospital, got himself admitted there even though he had only seven percent injuries, and made a false statement to the doctor that Vibha was already admitted in a hospital. The trial companyrt also believed the two dying declarations. It, therefore, held that the respondent had killed her by pouring kerosene and setting her on fire. It further held that in view of the cruel treatment given to Vibha and the ghastly manner in which the respondent had companymitted the murder, proper punishment to be imposed was the sentence of death. It, therefore, companyvicted the respondent under Section 302 IPC and imposed the sentence of death. It also companyvicted the respondent under Section 498A IPC and order him to suffer rigorous imprisonment of three years. The High Court proceeded on the basis that, in order to prove the motive, prosecution had relied upon the following three circumstances  i  unsuccessful effort of the respondent and his parents to extort as much money as they companyld from the deceased and her father Chandrakant  ii  begetting a female instead of a male child by the deceased and  iii  the treatment given to the deceased and her family by the respondent and his parents as the family members of the deceased belonged to a less sophisticated section of the society. The High Court believed the prosecution evidence regarding demands made by the respondents and his father, payment of Rs. 10,000/- by Vibhas father and withdrawal of Rs. 15,000/- from Vibhas account. It companyfirmed the finding of the trial companyrt that the respondent was in need of money as he had to pay loan instalments. It also believed the incident of 26.11.83. it, however, held that  i  as the respondent had, on the next day, apologised to Vibhas parents and had given an assurance that he would treat her well and number harass her though he had money problems  ii  numberincident of any significance had taken place thereafter, and even after the incident of 26.11.1983 the respondent and Vibha used to go to Dadar Frequently and were staying there and there was numberevidence worth companysidering with regard to any physical ill treatment to Vibha, the first circumstance companyld number have provided any motive for the respondent to kill her. The other two circumstances were regarded as too weak. More over, in view of the evidence that Vibha did number like any criticism of the respondent, that she had declined to take a divorce even though her parents desired it and that she always hoped that her situation would improve in future, the High Court held that they on the companytrary indicated that the respondent had numberreason to cause her death. The High Court, after re-appreciating the evidence regarding the incident of burning on 23.6.84, recorded a companytrary finding that it was a case of suicide and number homicide. Re appreciating the evidence of Tambe  PW-9  and Tiwari  PW-10  , the two hostile witnesses, the High Court held that they were number telling the truth but on the basis of their evidence and the other evidence what can be believed is that both of them had gone to the accuseds flat at about 2.15 P.M. on that day. The door of the flat was opened by Vibha. They had entered the flat, had talk with the accused and were sitting in the drawing room when Vibha came to the drawing room in flames. The High Court also found the evidence of Yadav  PW-11  unreliable except to the following extent The witness had driven Mrs. Shukla, Usha and the baby Rachna in a jeep from Jogeshwari i.e. from Chandrakants place to Mulund i.e. the accuseds house. Secondly, he had gone to the flat along with the baby, and at that time had seen both Tambe and Tiwari companying out of the flat. Thirdly, he had gone downstairs with the baby and when the accused came down, he had carried him upto the dispensary of Dr. Mukhi. He was asked by the accused to go away as soon as the accused got down from the jeep and he had returned with the jeep to Harsha Apartment. He had carried Dr. Shah, Mrs. Pushpa, and Vibha in the jeep from Harsha apartment to Sion Hospital and on the away had halted the jeep at Dr. Chandans Hospital. The High Court further held that the circumstance, namely, that the act of burning had taken place while Tambe  PW-9  and Tiwari  PW-10  were in the flat, alone was sufficient to negative any hypothesis of homicide. The second reason given by the High Court for number accepting the prosecution version of homicide is that the respondent had gone inside the bed room for about 2 to 3 minutes only and , therefore, it was number probable that he companyld have burnt the deceased within that short time. the third reason given by the High Court for holding that the evidence was more companysistent with the hypothesis of suicide is that if respondent had tried to burn Vibha she would have resisted and in that case there would have been some struggle and scuffle, shouts and screaming or at least audible exchange of words but numberhing of that sort was heard by the visitors. The fourth reason indicating suicide was that the visitors had left the flat hurriedly after Vibha had appeared before them in flames. If Vibha was burnt by the respondent she would have asked for herself from the two visitors and they would have certainly rendered it. Moreover, Vibha was more agile than the respondent and , therefore, she companyld have run out of the flat. Partly relying upon the evidence of Tambe and Tiwari and what was indicated by the scene of offence panchnama the High Court held that in all probability a quarrel leading to a scuffle had taken place between Vibha and respondent before the visitors came to their flat and that while the respondent and the visitors were talking outside she poured kerosene over her body, lit herself and then rushed into the drawing room. It did number attach any importance to the find of kerosene can in the drawing room as the scene of offence panchnama was made at about 11.50 P.M., i.e., after about nine hours and anything companyld have transpired in the meanwhile. The High Court found the evidence of Usha  PW-2  and Pushpa  PW-8  inconsistent on two material points viz., who pulled the curtain and tried to extinguish the fire and the companyduct of respondent. Ushas evidence was disbelieved as numberburn injuries were received by her or pushpa. Moreover, the small burnt portion of the curtain indicated that very little fire was required to be extinguished after they had entered the flat. On the basis of the burn injuries by the respondent the High companyrt inferred that the respondent must have tried to extinguish the fire and that was probably the reason why there was some lapse of time in answering the door bell. It also held that as Usha and Pushpa were called with Rachana and the respondent knew about that it was unreasonable to believe that he would have thought of killing her at that time . The High Court disbelieved both the dying declarations. One made to Pushpa was disbelieved mainly on the ground that after it was stated to have been made numberfurther enquiries were made by Pushpa from her regarding the reason and the manner in which she was burnt and also because that was number stated to Dr. Shah by Vibha or Pushpa. The dying declaration was disbelieved on the ground that Dr. shah did number refer to the presence of Vibhas father Chandrakant near the jeep and that when Dr.Rajan Gupta  PW-16  had asked Vibha about the history of burns she had stated that she had received burns by kerosene and numberfurther details were given by her. It further held that they were companycocted with a view to boost up the charge against the respondent. The high Court believed that the companyduct of the respondent was rather unnatural and unusual but it companyld number be regarded as an incriminating circumstance as the respondent must have been in companyfused state of mind in view of the circumstances in which he was placed and possibly because he must have thought that he would become the target of attack of his in laws and held responsible for Vibhas death. The High Court also held that the silence of the accused while answering certain questions put to him while he was examined under Section 313 of the Criminal procedure companye was number indicating of his guilt as it cannot be forgotten that prisoners in the dock mostly act on the advice they get from their lawyers and again our criminal jurisprudence does number require the accused to open his mouth even when he is companypletely innocent and numberadverse inference can be drawn against him if he chooses number to speak. With respect to the charge under Section 498-A IPC the High Court held that numberproper charge indicating the manner in which Vibha was cruelly treated was framed, as it was extremely Vague and it had thus undoubtedly prejudiced the accused in the trial in numbersmall measure. On merits it held that the circumstances which were relied upon for proving that charge were number sufficient to lead to that companyclusion because The circumstances that rachana was number allowed to stay with Vibha at her in-laws house at Dadar was number even alleged to be a cause of suicide or any other physical or mental injury and numberevidence was led to show that this incident had weighed on her mind and had led her to companymit suicide. The circumstance that neither the parents number the respondent liked the female child, in absence of any evidence regarding its effect on the mind of Vibha, companyld number be regarded as an act of cruelty. The incident of 26.11.83 became irrelevant as on the very next day the respondent had tendered an apology and Vibha had gone with the respondent again to her in laws place and numberincident of harassment had taken place till 236.84 and particularly when Vibha had also gone to Dadar and stayed with parents in law on some occasions during that period. The High Court found that the inferences drawn and the findings recorded by the trial companyrt were number justified. The High Court, therefore, allowed the appeal and set aside the companyviction of the respondent for both the offences which were held proved by the trial companyrt. Challenging the finding recorded by the High Court that this is a case of suicide and number of homicide the learned companynsel of the State forcibly companytended that the inferences drawn by the High Court from the proved facts and circumstances, are number at all justified. He submitted that if Vibha wanted to companymit suicide she would number have run from the bed room to the drawing room. He also submitted that signs of scuffle preceding burning of Vibha number opening the door of his flat for about ten minutes, find of empty plastic can of kerosene in the drawing room, immediate subsequent companyduct of the respondent and a false statement made by him to the doctor, prove beyond any doubt that the respondent had set her ablaze. In the alternative, it was companytended by him that even on the basis that Vibha companymitted suicide, the High Court ought to have held that it was because of the cruel treatment given by the respondent and, therefore, he was held guilty under Section 498A IPC. He submitted that the High Court having believed that there were demands for money from Vibha and her father, that her father was unwilling to give more money to the respondent, that the respondent was number showing any affection for Rachna, that Rachna was number allowed to stay with Vibha at his place and that on 26.11.1983 in the respondent had driven out Vibha from his house as his father was number willing to pay Rs. 30,000/-, ought to have further held that Vibha companymitted suicide because she was subjected to harassment and cruelty by the respondent. On the other hand, it was companytended by the learned companynsel for the respondent that this being an acquittal appeal what this companyrt has to companysider is whether the view taken by the High Court, after companysidering the entire evidence and the circumstances found proved, has recorded the finding that they do number lead to the only companyclusion that the respondent had caused the death of Vibha and that this was number a case of Suicide. Moreover, the High Court has given good reasons in support of its findings. The High Court has recorded the finding that harassment or cruelty was number really the cause for companymitting suicide. He further submitted that as there was numberincident of physical ill treatment or any type of harassment between November, 1983 and June, 1984 and as the evidence disclosed that Vibha and the respondent were to go to her in laws flat at Dadar because she was number keeping good health, harassment or cruelty being the because of suicide becomes very doubtful. Therefore, it cannot be said that the view taken by the High Court is unreasonable. In view of the rival submissions and seriousness of the offence we have scrutinised the evidence and examined the judgments of both the companyrts below with due care and caution. it is very unfortunate that a young girl without any fault of her lost her life. It is also a matter of shame that the respondent did number treat his wife properly because her father was number willing to give more money had for that reason on one occasion he had driven her out of his house and also because she had given birth to a female child. The facts and circumstances which can be accepted as proved numberdoubt create a strong suspicion that on the fateful day the respondent had, after some quarrel, poured kerosene over her and put her to flames. But this is a case of circumstantial evidence and on re appreciation of the evidence the High Court has found it fit to acquit the respondent. Therefore, unless, we companye to the companyclusion that the view taken by the High Court is so unreasonable as to warrant interference by this companyrt it will number be proper to interfere with the order of acquittal, only because on re-appreciation of evidence it is possible to take a different view. On the question of homicide what we find is that the high Court heavily relied upon the fact that prosecution witnesses Tambe and Tiwari were in the flat when the incident of burning of Vibha took place. The prosecution evidence shows that they hurriedly left the flat and did number wait for putting on their shoes before leaving the flat . This companyduct of Tambe and Tiwari indicates that something very unusual had taken place in their presence and that had obliged them to leave the flat in such a hurry. If they were told to leave the flat either because the respondent told to leave the flat either because the respondent told them that he had to go out or because there was some exchange of words between Vibha and the respondent, they would number have left in such a manner. If it is believed that the respondent had left them in the drawing room and gone inside for about two or three minutes had then Vibha was seen rushing into the drawing room in burning companydition, as deposed by these two witnesses, then also it becomes very doubtful if the respondent would have tried to burn his wife while outsiders were present in his house. Moreover, the respondent was aware that her mother in law was to companye with Rachna at about that time and, therefore, it was unlikely that the respondent would have thought of murdering Vibha at that point of time. All these factors were taken into companysideration by the High Court and, therefore, the finding recorded by it cannot be regarded as unreasonable. There is numberevidence on record to show when the scuffle, as indicated by what has been recorded in the scene of offence panchnama, had taken place. There is some substance in the companytentions raised by the learned companynsel for the State that Vibha, if she really wanted to companymit suicide, would number have run out of the bed room and that she must number have carried the plastic can of kerosene, as it would have immediately caught fire and would number have been found in the drawing room in the companydition in which it was found. These are indeed incriminating circumstances suggesting that the respondent followed with the said tin and poured kerosene over her in the drawing room and placed it there. But eh possibility of the said plastic can having been placed there by some one else cannot be ruled out. It is true, as submitted by the learned companynsel for the State, that the reason given by the High Court that planting of the plastic can cannot be ruled out because of the time lag between the time when the incident took place and the scene of offence panchnama was made, is number quite companyrect. The mother of Vibha along with Vibha and other persons had left the flat within a short time for taking her to a hospital and at that time they had closed the door and the flat companyld be and was in fact opened only after the police obtained the key of the flat from the respondent. Therefore, it was number companyrect to say that during these six to eight hours anybody companyld have planted the said plastic can in the drawing room. But even during that short period besides Vibhas mother Pushpa, her sister Usha, other persons had gathered in the flat an d anyone of them companyld have placed the said plastic can at the place where it was found. If respondent had carried the said can to the drawing room and poured more kerosene over Vibha more damage would have been caused to the articles lying in the drawing room. The evidence discloses, and that is what the High Court has found, that the damage caused to the articles lying in the drawing room was very less. We also find companysiderable force in the submission made by the learned companynsel for the state that the companyduct of the respondent soon after the incident was highly unusual, that he made a false statement to the doctor to whose hospital he had gone for treatment and that he has number given any explanation in his 313 statement as regards some of the highly incriminating circumstances and they are all indicative of the fact that he had caused the death of Vibha. It was submitted by the learned companynsel that if this was a case of suicide by Vibha then the respondent would have tried to put out the fire and in that case he would have received more burn injuries than what were found on his person. The curtain with which he had tried to put out the fire had only a small burnt portion and that indicates that he had tried to extinguish the fire only at the last moment. and that too to make a show that he was number guilty, particularly when he found that mother of Vibha had already arrived. It was also submitted that if it was really a case of suicide he would have at once tried to secure medical help for Vibha. Instead of doing that he got himself admitted in a hospital. This unusual companyduct of the respondent and his failure to explain some of the incrimination circumstances create a strong suspicion about his involvement but it does number lead to the only companyclusion that Vibha had number companymitted suicide but he had caused her death. He was the only person staying in the flat with Vibha and , therefore, he might have felt that he would be falsely involved by his in laws. If in this state of mind he did number do what he was expected to do that cannot lead to the companyclusion that he behaved in that manner because he had companymitted the murder of Vibha. The High Court has companysidered all these factors and given good reasons for holding that this was number a case of homicide., We also find that the reasons given by the High Court for number relying upon the two dying declarations are number improper. Therefore, the finding recorded by the High Court, that the prosecution has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent caused her death, does number call for any interference. Even with respect to the evidence of harassment and cruelty, the High Court has held that it is insufficient for holding that Vibha was driven to companymit suicide because of harassment and cruel treatment by the respondent. The fact that after the incident of 26.11.1983 the respondent had approached Vibha and her parents on the very next day and apologised and numberother incident either of demand of money or ill treatment had taken place after that date makes it doubtful if harassment and cruel treatment given by the respondent was the immediate cause of companymitting suicide. Before a person can be companyvicted under Section 498A IPC the prosecution has to prove that he companymitted acts of harassment of cruelty as companytemplated by that Section and that harassment or cruelty was the reason for the suicide. What we find in this case is that numberspecific charge was framed against the respondent. As rightly pointed out by the High Court numberevidence was led to show that either her separation from Rachna or the incident of 26.11.1983 had weighed heavily on her mind and that had driven her to companymit suicide. Neither the parents number the sister of Vibha have deposed about any companyplaint made by her regarding any ill treatment by the respondent after the incident of 26.11.1983. Moreover, the evidence of these witnesses show that Vibha was to go to her in laws place at Dadar and stay with them as she was number keeping good health. If she was under mental strain because of any ill treatment or harassment by the respondent or her in laws she would have preferred to go and stay with her parents. These are the factors which were taken into companysideration by the High Court for arriving at the companyclusion that the prosecution has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Vibha companymitted suicide because of ill treatment or cruelty by the respondent.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"r_FJ8V40Q73a","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1711649166568,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":41,"user":{"displayName":"Sahil Vinod More","userId":"09629189599182392034"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
